    <desc>In the year 2020, baseball finally evolved. There is no longer conventional professional baseball in 2020. Baseball designed by the Super Baseball Association has been very popular and is the best sport.

However, the truth is that the association has used a colossal sum of money to promote Super Baseball as show business. They have manipulated each player&apos;s ability using the control computer to secretly decide victory or defeat in every game. The players who knew this removed the connecting parts of the computer to play their own game of baseball. Finally, a fair game is going to be played at Cyber Egg Stadium.

In 2020 Super Baseball is a fast-paced game with new rules, where you can select 1 of 12 individual men, women, or robot players. During play, you can make your team stronger with prizes earned from amazing catches.

    <desc>3 Count Bout is a one-on-one fighting game. Choose from ten wrestlers who have their own power attacks. There are ten rounds in the game, and each one of them has you fighting other wrestlers that are much tougher than the previous ones. You defeat each one by biting, kicking, and performing other moves to the point where their damage meter is empty. But just because it is empty doesn&apos;t mean that you win. You have to pin him for the infamous-three count. Also features competitive play and tag match battles.</desc>

    <desc>Aggressors of Dark Kombat is another one-on-one street fighting beat &apos;em up from the Neo-Geo&apos;s seemingly endless library of fighters.

It pits 8 fighters of different styles and strengths against each other in a tournament to see who&apos;s the toughest mofo on the streets of Tokyo. Your objective as usual is to deplete your opponent&apos;s health bar within the time limit by using your basic attacks and special moves (triggered by specific controller motions) while avoiding his moves and attacks.

Unique to Aggressors of Dark Kombat is the combination of traditional side-scrolling beat &apos;em up elements, meaning characters can freely move in an isometric space instead of being restricted to a single plane of movement. Weapons and throw-able items are usually thrown into the arena by the crowds and you can pick them up and wield them for added damage. Additionally, matches are 1-round only affairs, with an extended multi-layered health bar that allows for longer rounds than usual.</desc>

    <desc>The invasion of an unknown life source is getting worse. Nobody knows if the defensive line or the heart of the enemy base is ruined first. With the people&apos;s hope, the most advanced fighter will be dispatched into multi-scrolling space.

Fight your way through seven stages in this horizontal-scrolling game, and defeat a boss at the end of each one. You start the game with four main weapons, which you can switch from with the click of a button. Some of these weapons are more powerful than others. You can also fire off a charged shot if your main weapon level is two or greater, simply by holding down the fire button for about two seconds. Using charged shots can do more damage to an enemy ship. If you happen to die, you will lose one power level from all four weapons. If all your lives are lost and are forced to continue, you will start again with your main weapon on the second power level and all three sub-weapons on the first power level.</desc>

    <desc>The storyline of Art of Fighting takes place in 1978. Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia set out to find Ryo&apos;s sister, Yuri, who was kidnapped by Mr. Big. Mr. Big took Yuri to entice Takuma Sakazaki, Ryo&apos;s father and originator of Kyokugen Karate, and also because Ryo refused to work for Big. After Ryo &amp; Robert defeat Mr. Big, they face the enigmatic Mr. Karate. Art of Fighting&apos;s story ends with a cliff-hanger; Yuri is about to disclose the true identity of Mr. Karate as their father Takuma.</desc>

    <desc>In this sequel to the original Art of Fighting, and prequel to the original Fatal Fury, we learn that Mr. Karate, the final boss of the original game, behind the mask, is really Takuma Sakazaki, Ryo and Yuri&apos;s father, that Takuma was being used by Geese Howard for his own evil intentions, and that Mr. Big was the one who had originally kidnapped Yuri.

Many of the problems that existed in the first game have been fixed in this installment (it is easier to execute special moves, you no longer have only Ryo or Robert to choose from in 1 player mode, etc.).

The entire cast from the first Art of Fighting is here (with the exceptions of Todo and Mr. Karate), along with a few new characters: Takuma Sakazaki, Ryo and Yuri&apos;s father; Yuri Sakazaki, Takuma&apos;s daughter and Ryo&apos;s sister; Eiji Kisaragi, a sworn enemy of the Sakazakis; Temjin, a Mongolian trucker; and a younger version of Geese Howard, whom you face as the last boss if you beat the game without losing a round.</desc>

    <desc>In this third and final entry in the Art of Fighting series, the story shifts from Ryo Sakazaki to his best friend and rival, Robert Garcia, as he ventures into Mexico to try and locate Freia Lawrence, a childhood friend, who asked for his help. However, he leaves without the consent of The Garcia Foundation, which sends an agent named Karman Cole to get him back. But not everything is as simple as it looks... because Robert is not the only one looking for Freia.

Art of Fighting 3: The Path of The Warrior features ten playable characters with different fighting styles, a completely new fighting system based on joystick and button combinations, and incredibly detailed graphics and animation.

    <desc>This follow up to Baseball Stars Professional features a fast-paced arcade style baseball with six fictitious teams, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.  There are two difficulties of play: Beginner, which automatically fields the ball for the player while Exciting has the player do the field manually.  Additionally, there are two main modes of play where in the single player mode the player will compete in a fifteen-team tournament or go head-to-head against a friend in a multiplayer mode.

The standard rules of baseball still apply, but it adds power-ups that the player can pick up and use during the game, such as the ability for their pitcher to throw faster or their batter to hit better.  They can also substitute a player during the game, but are limited to three substitutions per game. The game is shown through 2D graphics with comic-style cutscenes to illustrate the action, such as dramatic catches and home runs that will pop-up during the game.</desc>

    <desc>The planet of Raguy was once beautiful and peaceful, but all hell broke loose when it was invaded by the Daruma tribe. The pollution started to spread through the city. Blue was summoned to get rid of the Daruma tribe, and save Raguy from the Daruma Empire that has turned the inhabitants into slaves.

You control Blue, who only has one weapon to deal with the Darumas. You can use his leaf to whip enemies upside-down, and hurl these enemies at others. Along the way, you can get flowers for use at the shop to buy items that will help you along the way. These items include flower honey (increases stamina), swim fins (easier swimming), light safe (protects all your items), spikes, and ocarinas. Later in the game, you can also get the shopkeeper to sing you a song. This helps you break curses that are placed on you by a witch.You will also interact with other characters along the way that can also help you if you tell the truth.

You exit each stage by jumping on a huge plant. The higher up you are on this plant, the more points you are awarded. Every two or so stages, you have to defeat a boss before a guy in a devil suit offers you something. You can refuse or accept the other. If you accept the offer, you will have to pull one of four strings that will give you a life ball, more stamina, 30 flowers, cocoons, or five flowers.

You are on a time limit. If you run out of time, a black creature appears out of nowhere, and starts firing &quot;bird&quot; missiles at you.</desc>

The object of each battle is to drain your opponent&apos;s energy in order to win the battle. If there is a draw, a third battle takes place. If the time limit expires, the player with the less energy loses the battle. Once you have completed all eight stages, you will face a opponent that is much tougher than previous ones. Different endings and in-game dialog are viewed depending on the character that you select.</desc>

    <desc>Puzzle Bobble (known as Bust-A-Move outside of Japan) is a spin-off of the Bubble Bobble series, featuring themes from the original game (such as enemies trapped in bubbles by the cutesy dinosaur duo Bub and Bob that must be popped). Players attempt to clear a board of colored bubbles by firing other bubbles at an angle and matching multiple bubbles of the same color. Its characteristically cute Japanese animation and music, along with its play mechanics and level designs, made it successful as an arcade title and spawned several sequels and ports to home gaming systems.</desc>

    <desc>Ironclad is a side scrolling shooter developed by Saurus in 1996. Ironclad was first shown in its native MVS cartridge format at the March 1996 ACME show in Orlando, Florida. I saw and played the game at the show. We always knew therefore that at the very least, one proto was available on the MVS format. Although the game saw release on the NEOGEO CD system, it was never officially released in either the MVS or HOME cartridge formats. Ironclad was the most sought after of all the CD-protos because of its appeal to shoot &apos;em up fans. This was most likely why it had coincidentally caused the largest number of false claims; more then any other proto cartridge! 13 years later, in November of 2009, SNK finally released the native ROM data for the game and as a result we finally got the game and can now enjoy it forever!</desc>

    <desc>As a knight, you must travel the countryside fighting monsters and bandits using your sword and shield. When you enter combat the view changes to a pseudo 1st-person perspective where the body of your knight is outlined so that you can see the creatures that you are fighting. When enemies have been defeated, they drop money and power-ups. There are seven chapters in the game, and each chapter (except one) starts with you entering a merchant&apos;s shop and buying weapons using the money that you have collected so far. There are also alternate paths which take you to different parts of the game. At the start of the game, you may choose a chapter (from one to three only) you want to start at.</desc>

There are ten characters to choose from, including Billy and Jimmy and the game has colorful interactive backgrounds, screen zooming, over-the-top special moves and with the inclusion of double jumps, combos, charges for the losing player and counter hits, there is plenty of room for advanced fighting strategies.</desc>

The object, as Eightman (or Nineman), is to move left or right punching enemies and fight a boss at the end of the level. In some levels, you are chasing after a vehicle while enemies jump out at you. Power-ups can be collected along the way, which, when collected will make your kicks and punches stronger as well as give you bombs which are used to damage all enemies. If a two-player game is in progress, a spark will be between them and their bomb power will be increased.</desc>

    <desc>&quot;Kabuki Klash&quot; is a 2D fighting game that features characters from the famous Japanese role-playing series  Tengai Makyou, also known as Far East of Eden. The heroes of the three first Tengai Makyou games must participate in a tournament and find out who is the most skillful fighter in the magical land of Jipang (which is very similar to the medieval Japan). The characters include well-known Far East of Eden heroes such as Ziria, Manjimaru, Kabuki, Orochimaru, and others - a total of eight playable characters. During the fights, you can either punch, kick, or use special attacks, that require a precise usage of buttons and also deplete your magic gauge. There are random items (such as healing potions) thrown on the battle field while you are fighting, which you can pick up.

    <desc>There are 8 characters to select from and two boss characters (the first boss character is only playable in two player mode). The object of the game is to win two matches out of three. Each character has a set of moves in addition to two basic punches and kicks. Each character also has a super move called a &quot;Danger Move&quot;, which are similar to the Desperation Moves from Fatal Fury 2. Players also have the ability to taunt others, but unlike games such as Art of Fighting, this has no effect and would actually leave the player open to attacks.</desc>

Around this time, many abductions had occurred by a mysterious group of ninjas, and Otsu was one of the missing. What is the true purpose of these ninjas? The time to fight has come again for Musashi!!

You must guide Musashi or his sister, Suzame, around several locations defeating a horde of ninjas with only a sword. Weapon power-ups and life bonuses can be collected along the way. You can jump high and use your grappling hook to attach to and climb some ceilings, as well as attaching yourself to faraway objects. At the end of each location, you must defeat a guardian in order to continue the game. Cut-scenes are viewed between locations.</desc>

Rather than looking to be saved from death after falling off his office balcony, Geese instead decided to die, and left behind his young son, Rock.

    <desc>Ghost Lop is an excellent Ghostbusters themed puzzle game by Data East from 1996. It combines the fast action of an Arkanoid style game, with the quick thinking of a Bust-A-Move type game. The game was re-considered for release in 2001, but SNK&apos;s untimely demise later that same year may have ended that possibility. Data East was best known for its&apos; Chain Reaction / Magical Drop series of puzzle games, and even later included the Ghostlop characters in one of the later releases for modern home game systems.</desc>

    <desc>Karnov&apos;s Revenge is a 2-D Street Fighter II clone from Data East. Choose one of 13 fighters from around the world to play as, each with their unique moves and special attacks. As usual, there are two rounds in each stage, and the object of each round is to drain your opponent&apos;s energy in order to win the battle. If there is a tie after two rounds, a third round is played. There is a time limit, and if this expires, the player with the less energy loses.

    <desc>The King of Fighters &apos;94 is notable in that it is one of the first known fighting games that pits a team of fighters against each other in single combat. Each team consists of three fighters for each player, the winner being the player who is able to eliminate the other team first. Each active character can charge up &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; style in order to gain access to &quot;Desperation Moves&quot;, or &quot;DMs&quot; (moves which operate very much like Street Fighter&apos;s Super Combos). Playing against the computer, the player must defeat all 8 teams in the game in order to reach the final boss, Rugal Bernstein.</desc>

    <desc>The first sequel in the King of Fighters series picks up a year after the end of the first tournament. Once again, fighters from all over the world receive a mysterious invitation to a team-based fighting tournament. And just like last year, it appears that the notorious criminal Rugal Bernstein is behind it, apparently returning from the dead to raise havok once again...

The King of Fighters &apos;95 introduces Kyo Kusanagi&apos;s rival Iori Yagami, and firmly places Kyo as the main character for the rest of the series. The gameplay of The King of Fighters &apos;95 is essentially unchanged from the previous title, though it does introduce the &quot;team edit&quot; concept which would remain as a standard feature of the series. Using the &quot;team edit&quot; feature, it is possible to create a totally customized team using any of the available fighters, or use one of the default teams if you wish.</desc>

    <desc>SNK&apos;s flagship series returns for another year. Many of the changes in this year&apos;s KOF release come in the form of improved graphics, sound effects, music and totally redone character sprites. The gameplay of the system has been altered with the addition of &quot;Rush&quot; multi-hit combos and new moves for practically every character. The storyline of the series receives heavy focus in this release with the Orochi Saga swinging into high-gear. Other features carried over from the previous year include the ability to choose between the default &quot;Team Fighting&quot; mode or the traditional &quot;Single Fighter&quot; style of gameplay, plus the &quot;Versus&quot; and &quot;Survival&quot; gameplay modes.</desc>

    <desc>Another year, another KOF. Additions this year come in the form of slightly improved graphics and sounds, new moves and a new game mode. Gameplay is much more plot-driven, as you have middle-bosses that can change depending on what team you select. In addition, there are several special endings which are only shown when certain &quot;Edit Team&quot; combinations are selected. New characters include the New Face Team, the Fatal Fury Outlaw Team (featuring the KOF debut of &quot;Blue&quot; Mary Ryan and Ryuji Yamazaki, and the return of Billy Kane), and Kyo&apos;s pupil Shingo Yabuki. In total, The King of Fighters &apos;97 sports 29 separate characters.</desc>

    <desc>The King of Fighters &apos;98 takes a break from the Orochi plot line and instead is presented as a &quot;Dream Match&quot; game where the KOF roster duke it out for the top spot (similar to Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, but without the storyline component). Most of the characters from the past four years return, thus providing the player with a very large roster containing 38 characters. Many of the characters have been altered in an attempt to make the game balanced regardless of the player&apos;s choice of fighter. Rugal Bernstein is provided as a non-secret character for the first time in KOF &apos;98, and several regular characters have hidden &quot;alternate&quot; versions that may also be used in-game.</desc>

    <desc>The final King of Fighters game released by SNK in its original state, The King of Fighters 2000 expands on the story and gameplay presented in The King of Fighters &apos;99. This year&apos;s tournament is sponsored by the Ikari Warriors in an attempt to discover more about the NESTS organization, and to derail the plans of potential NESTS agents K&apos; and Maxima. Not everything is as straight-forward as it usually is, however, and even the Ikari Warriors themselves are at risk of being betrayed from within by the end of the tournament.</desc>

However, the NESTS organization is once again standing in the participant&apos;s way; they have deployed their own team of four fighters, lead by two individuals of high-rank within NESTS: a man claiming to be the original Zero and Igniz, the CEO of NESTS. The character roster has been updated yet again for this release in the series.</desc>

    <desc>The second plotless &quot;dream match&quot; in The King of Fighters series, this game sports 39 normal characters and 5 hidden characters, some of whom haven&apos;t appeared since KOF98. The King of Fighters 2002 also has five characters exclusive to the X-Box, the PS2 and/or Dreamcast systems: Shingo Yabuki, King, Geese Howard, &quot;Riot of the Blood&quot; Iori and Leopold Goenitz. Shingo and King are available on all the non-Neo Geo systems, while Geese and the rest are only available on the PS2 and X-Box platforms.

The gameplay system has also changed. The striker system and four-character teams found in the last three KOF releases have been totally removed. In their place are the old-school three man teams and the &quot;Advanced system&quot; from The King of Fighters &apos;97 and The King of Fighters &apos;98.

    <desc>Like The King of Fighters 2002, this game reverts back to the old 3-on-3 format used from KOF &apos;94 to KOF &apos;98. A new feature to this game that old-school KOF fans might have trouble getting used to is the new interchangeable team system. You still pick three characters and decide your character order before a match, but now you have the option to change to another character during a match. You can change at any time during a match, but you cannot when two of your teammates have been taken out, and only one character is left in reserve.</desc>

    <desc>The object of King of the Monsters 2 is similar to its predecessor. Choose from three monsters which include a large lizard, a large robotic ape, and a huge mutant human. Then walk through each city, making sure to destroy everything in site, including planes, buildings, and other creatures. When smashed, some buildings reveal power-ups that make your character more powerful. At the end of each city, you go head-to-head with the boss creature. There are small stages in between where you fight a second monster for bonus points, or you fall from the sky and land underwater where you try to collect points and power-ups while falling.

    <desc>In Magical Drop II, you control a clown that can grab and throw balloons. You have to match three balloons of the same colour or more vertically to pop them and clear the screen. You can hold multiple balloons of the same colour at once and cause consecutive collisions. There are special balloons that cannot be removed that easily and power-ups that clear entire rows or provide additional help.

Depending of the originating country, there are different game modes:

1. Survival: Play as long as you can - an endless flow of balloons appears at a rapidly increasing speed while you move up levels.

2. Puzzle: You have a limited time to clear a fixed set of balloons before time runs out.

3. VS Mode: Fight the CPU or a fellow player in a direct split-screen duel. Each character has specific item balloons during gameplay.</desc>

    <desc>This is the third installment in the puzzle frenzy series Magical Drop. In the game you control a clown who throws marbles up on the screen into the cluster of multi-colored marbles, rocks and crystals. The goal is to get three or more of the same color to remove marbles, but you can also grab more than one at the time to create long chain combos and gain better &quot;special&quot; blocks at the top of the screen.

You can play the game in single player modes or versus a friend in versus mode. In versus mode you get to pick your character, much like in a fighting game, each with their own counter attacks and abilities.

For the PSX version, the first Magical Drop was included on a separate disc.</desc>

    <desc>Magician Lord puts you in charge of Elta, a wizard who has the task of collecting eight books of wisdom from the clutches of Az Atorse, the god of destruction. By collecting the right power-ups along the way, you can transform into different characters, including the Rajin, Samurai, Waterman, Shinobi, Poseidon, and Dragon Warrior. Each character has different abilities. There are eight areas in the game, and each stage ends with you trying to defeat both a guardian and the end-of-area boss (which are basically Atorse&apos;s incarnations). One of the first games that demonstrated the graphical abilities of the Neo-Geo.</desc>

    <desc>Metal Slug, originally released on the Neo Geo, is a side-scrolling shoot&apos;em&apos;up.

The player(s) takes the role of a soldier (or two) and fights a gigantic army. Every level consists of running forward blasting anything that moves, while collecting power-ups along the way (there&apos;s also a wide selection of weaponry in the game). In the end of each level the player goes up against one gigantic boss. 

The PlayStation port introduces some extra features: there is a combat school where the player may fight with other players for the best time on each level and an art gallery.

    <desc>MPE combines the gameplay mechanics of the Magical Drop games with some lightning-fast coin-counting addition--call it &quot;Mathical Drop.&quot; Instead of bubbles, MPE players (most of whom are presented as schoolchildren in pastel-colored fantasy costumes) stack coins that combine to make higher denominations--five 1 coins will turn into a single 5, two 5&apos;s become a 10, five 10&apos;s turn into 50 and so forth, on up to 500 (two of those will disappear completely). One-player games offer either solo endurance rounds or matches against a ladder of CPU opponents, but as with MD, it&apos;s the two-player mode that makes the game the most fun.</desc>

Mutation Nation is a 1-2 player action game where you must control your hero and beat up any mutant that gets in your way, by either using your fists or one of four special attacks. A boss at the end of each area needs to be defeated if you want to proceed further through the game.</desc>

In the game, you must shoot enemy soldiers, tanks, helicopters, jeeps, and more by aiming the machine gun cursor and shooting at them. Within each location, you can pick up more powerful weapons such as machine guns and flame throwers, but these have a limited supply of ammunition. Pressing down on the joystick while running at the same time will cause your character to perform a somersault and be invincible for a second. At the end of every location, you will need to defeat a series of bosses, which are not the same every play. Cut-scenes are viewed in between locations, and contain dramatic digitized dialogue.</desc>

To do this, you clear a path of blocks by setting bombs that will detonate a few seconds later, and then use the bombs to wipe out enemies. Some blocks will uncover power-ups, and depending on which ones you collect, you will receive more bombs, more lives, more time, manual bomb detonation, expanded blast zone, and the ability to move faster. In some levels some blocks will reveal eggs that you can hatch to produce a bird that you can ride on and allows you to take an additional hit from an enemy or bomb blast without losing a life.</desc>

    <desc>This was an ancient story when people still believed in witchcraft.

There lived one gravedigger at a very small village in a remote region. He lived a quiet, solitary life in a corner of the cemetery. He kept away from the village people due to his very ugly appearance. One day, he found the graves were ransacked and some corpses were stolen. He didn&apos;t want the village people to find out, so he decided to eliminate the grave burglars by himself. Thus, he patrolled the cemetery every night.

There are five stages with five levels each, and each one of them has you throwing fireballs at ghouls, ghosts, goblins, and zombies. When you keep throwing fireballs at these enemies, they will ignite into a giant fireball, which you can throw at other enemies to kill them, and get the remaining treasure before moving on to the next level. At the end of the fifth level, a boss must be defeated in order to continue the game.</desc>

    <desc>That one-player game consists in facing nine opponents through duels with individual screens. Each one in his playground have to stack blocks composed of three different colored helmets. Like Tetris, it is possible to rotate, move left or right or accelerate the fall of these blocks. Starting from three identical helmets lined up horizontally, vertically or diagonally, they explode and generate a bomb in the playground. When they disappear, they can initiate chain reactions, for example with the blocks lying above falling. After a certain number of removed blocks, comes an activated bomb: player have to place it in order to make the most of these bombs explode on his table.</desc>

Your team plays against all the others in your group, then it goes into an elimination tournament&apos;s semifinals and then the final to win the cup. It&apos;s worth mentioning that Pleasure Goal&apos;s rules barely base on Futsal, which is basically a 5-on-5 player indoor soccer style. </desc>

    <desc>An alien threat looms over the galaxy and only you and your trusty star fighter can defeat them.

Pulstar is a 2D side-scrolling shooter in which you control your ship as it makes its way past stages filled with waves after waves of enemies bent on your destruction. You can upgrade your main weapons by collecting power-ups and charging up energy allows you to release charged attacks at the cost of power-up consumption. Additionally your ship comes with an ever-prescent &quot;option&quot; gun pod that floats around your ship and which can be positioned in several configurations to help protect the ship or increase its firepower.

While completely 2D, the game uses pre-rendered 3D sprites and includes fully animated cutscenes between each level. Also features support for two-player gameplay.</desc>

    <desc>The player clears the colored balls on the screen by firing balls against other balls of the same colour, the objective of the game is not to clear the screen of balls. It is instead to clear all the balls from around the level shape, referred to as the &quot;drop token&quot;. Once this shape is freed, it explodes and the player travels onto the next level. There are 39 levels in the game, divided in groups of three levels. In the first two levels, the shape is something generic; in the third level the shape is a Zodiac sign, up to level 36 (since there are 12 signs). Level 39&apos;s shape is the Solar Symbol.</desc>

    <desc>This game is a crossover between Tetris and Breakout (or Arkanoid) in that your balloon is trapped at the bottom of the puzzle, and you have to break the lines down far enough to give it a clear flight path to the top. Open up a space, and your balloon (shark-shaped if you&apos;re the boy) floats to the top, and it&apos;s on to the next floor in the tower. Sound easy? It is... at first. The tower is divided into multiple floors, with 10 stages (puzzles) per floor. There are over 50 puzzles here and the action gets pretty furious.</desc>

    <desc>Originally designed by Evoga to be a sequel to the 1995 fighting game Double Dragon (changing it to a homage after failing to acquire the intellectual rights to the series), Rage of the Dragons is a 2-on-2 tag-team fighting game with the same art style as Noise Factory&apos;s earlier Sengoku 3.

The story involves various pairs of martial artists and those with supernatural powers, with everybody having personal motivations for fighting in Sunshine City. Some of these fighters harness the power of dragon spirits (with brothers Billy and Jimmy Lewis controlling the Blue and Red Dragons and main antagonist Johann controlling the Black Dragon).</desc>

    <desc>SNK&apos;s Fatal Fury fighting series reaches its 7th episode bringing a lot of &quot;innovations&quot; and some significant changes, starting from characters: all the 20 fighters from previous game return with new artworks and battle stages completely redrawn, as well as some remodeled (or new) moves.

The traditional fighting system comes with sensible modifications, like the removal of both &quot;Rank System&quot; (SSS, SS, S, AAA etc.) and ground breakable objects. The match system using 2 battle plans (foreground/background) remains semi-intact, because now some battle fields (like Cheng Sinzan&apos;s stage) uses a single plane, forcing the players to use only the basic defense to avoid attacks.

But the main addition of this title (and the reason for subtitle &quot;The Newcomers&quot;) are 2 new characters entering for Fatal Fury&apos;s main cast: Rick Strowd, a mysterious fighter with a particular fighting style and Li Xiangfei, a young female Chinese martial arts fighter.

    <desc>Riding Hero is a motorcycle racing game with three modes of play: W.G.P. mode, R.P.G. (Story) mode, and Multi-Play mode.

In W.G.P mode, you pick your bike that you want to use, and then race up to ten world circuits, including France, Germany, Italy, U.S.A, Spain, Sweden, and more. You race against the top riders. Try to aim for the top.

R.P.G. mode is interactive. You travel between locations, and explore them, and speak to any people here. You start with no bike, so you must go to the Bike Shop and purchase one. Then with some help with the owner, you can race against up to six opponents. The more races you win, the more money you earn. Keep winning and you will be able to race the Suzuki 8-hour. During this mode, a timer will count down. If this expires, you must insert a coin in order to continue.

Multi-Play mode lets you &quot;link&quot; cabinets together so that two players can race each other side-by-side.</desc>

The possessed swordsman has brutally slaughtered innocents in his path, yet could not raise his blade to the cries of an innocent baby. Vowing never to spill innocent blood again, he targets those who live by the way of the sword...but now the hunter becomes the hunted. The third series of Samurai Shodown introduces 2 different techniques for each character. The &quot;Slash&quot; techniques are the original moves of the most of the characters whereas the &quot;Bust&quot; techniques maybe the &quot;darker&quot; version of each character.</desc>

    <desc>Bringing a new breath to SNK&apos;s swordsman fighting series, this 4th installment marks the return of 3 classic characters (Yagyu Jubei, Charlotte and Tam Tam, now with updated stuff), introduces 2 newcomers for the pantheon (the brothers Sogetsu Kazama and Kazuki Kazama) and brings some new backgrounds.

In spite of these little improvements, the game preserved (and improved a lot) many elements that did the previous one (Samurai Shodown III: Blades of Blood) a quite popular title, like the dodge move and the chance to choose between two versions of the fighter: the standard one and an alternative dark-styled one (SLASH and BUST, respectively).

With the intention to provide more action in the battles, the &quot;No Contest&quot; Moves were introduced: working in similar way (and under certain conditions) to the many games of Mortal Kombat Series, your fighter will execute an ultimate-slaughter move in a stunned opponent.

    <desc>Seven years after the fourth game in the series, Samurai Shodown returns. In the game&apos;s time frame, this is the earliest game, hence the Japanese title Samurai Spirits Zero. It takes place in 1786 from January through the later summer. The game is therefore considered a prequel to the series.

The overall gameplay was slightly altered. It is a little faster, and the Slash/Bust system has been removed. Each character now has only one version, or the Bust mode is simply replaced by a new character of very similar setup. Combo slashes, sidestepping and fatalities have also vanished. The basic moves have been modeled after the first games in the series. They consist of three types of slashes, a single kick, and various dodge maneuvers similar to Samurai Shodown II.

There are 24 characters, a familiar cast with some new faces. Unlike the previous games, it is not possible to kill your opponent.</desc>

    <desc>The evil King Lion has crowned himself as the master of Fuun-Ken, a new style of martial arts that includes throwing weapons in addition to hand-to-hand combat. This does not sit well with the rest of the Fuun-Ken fighters around the world, so they all decide to beat each other up in classic 2 round fights to decide who gets to get down with King Lion himself.

Savage Reign is a one-on-one 2D fighter in which you select your character and try to defeat all challengers using your basic attacks and special moves. The game features 2 different horizontal planes to which the characters can freely jump to in order to avoid attacks a la Fatal Fury. You cannot escape completely however, as all characters have a throwing weapon they can use in different ways to reach each other no matter where they are.</desc>

    <desc>A 2D side-scrolling beat &apos;em up, Sengoku casts you and a friend as two renegade fighters out to beat the crap out of the many assorted gangs that threaten the post-apocalyptic cities of the future. Unfortunately for them they also get caught in a time-warping scheme caused by the evil Nobunaga who attempts to invade the time period with mythical warriors and evil creatures from the Japanese sengoku period.

The game thus takes you from the city to a spirit-realm from time to time, in which you must fight all sorts of Japanese mythical figures, and release three haunted spirits that can aid you in your battle. Collecting orbs from defeated enemies allows you heal up, gain weapons and even energy attacks and also summon the warrior forms of the spirits you released, which change your character&apos;s form and give you a new collection of attacks and powers.</desc>

    <desc>A sequel to Sengoku, Sengoku 2 once again casts you as two street fighting heroes caught in the midst of a supernatural attack by the undead forces of the evil Nobunaga from the Japanese sengoku period, although this time the game warps you through several time periods and locations to fight evil, from feudal Japan to WWII Europe.

As in the original, the game plays as a standard 2D side-scrolling beat &apos;em up, in which you have to proceed through each stage killing all enemies that cross your path and defeating the stage boss to proceed. New for the sequel is the inclusion of swords as your default weapons, which now feature both high and low attacks, as well as a block move that allows you to parry enemy attacks. Collecting orbs gives you weapon upgrades and energy attacks, as well as the ability to morph into any of the three spirits released in the original which give you a new arsenal of moves and powers.</desc>

    <desc>The third game in the Sengoku series of beat &apos;em ups, Sengoku 3 once again pits you and a friend against the undead forces of Nobunaga, however this time you can freely select from a group of different characters each with their own weapons and abilities, as well as choose which location in the world (or level) to tackle whenever you want.

The game incorporates a more complex fighting system similar to a one-on-one fighting game, by giving players different attack buttons, special moves based on directional inputs, combos and even a super bar used to unleash devastating super moves. You cannot change weapons or transform into other characters as in the previous games, but you can acquire different ranged weapons for additional attacks as well as unlock certain bosses to increase your available characters.</desc>

    <desc>Shock Troopers is a 1-2 player game where players select one of eight characters to play as. Each character has their own attack. Players also have to choose one of three routes to take. The object of the game is to go toward the end of the level and defeat the end-of-level boss, which is usually a huge vehicle. Crates that are scattered throughout the levels can be broken into to reveal new weapons and power-ups.

There is a team mode where players have to select three characters. The characters can be switched on-the-fly during gameplay, which is useful if one of them is badly injured. Players can use the other teammates until life-ups can be found.</desc>

The second game in the Shock Troopers series enables shot locking, close proximity attacks, and evasive maneuvers allowing for flexible operation. In addition to the four characters, versatile modes of attack are featured using powerful vehicles and special shots. Letters that make up certain keywords can be collected throughout the game, and by collecting each letter in the keyword, you will receive a high score.

    <desc>An evil doctor has kidnapped John and Tom&apos;s friend, Mary, and has stolen their treasure map. Rescuing Mary and getting back all pieces of the map takes them through 5 levels of arcade-style Jump&apos;n Shoot-action.

There are several weapons to acquire, ranging from a yo-yo (the standard weapon) to bombs, icicles, missiles and more. Weapons differ in range, shooting frequency, and power, and can be shot in all directions. Each weapon also has a unique chargeable attack as well as a super-attack (which uses up one bomb-symbol).

It is also possible to jump on enemies or perform a sliding attack.</desc>

    <desc>Stakes Winner is a 2D horse racing game. Taking the role of horse jockeys, players must win a series of races using one of the game&apos;s eight selectable horses. Each horse is rated in strength, speed, and stamina, making each horse different in handling. During the game, horse ratings can be boosted through completing bonus levels. Each horse has a stamina bar displayed at the bottom of the screen, next to a picture of the horse&apos;s head showing its current health. The stamina bar decreases as the horse runs, and when it is depleted, the race is over for that horse.</desc>

    <desc>The player chooses one of six planes or can opt for a random choice. The first four stages are in random order, while the last four are sequential. Players collect weapon powerups, bombs, and gold bars for points. Each plane has a unique &quot;supershot&quot; which is charged by damaging enemies and fired by holding then releasing the fire button. Supershots can be stored, although the number varies from plane to plane. Using a bomb results in a large friendly fighter swooping onto the screen and blocking shots while returning fire for a few seconds.

After the player beats the final boss, the game starts again from the beginning, albeit at a much higher difficulty level. All level are similar to the ones in Strikers 1945 II. Only one of the four bosses that are randomly chosen and the sixth boss is changed.</desc>

This time around the teams are all formed by characters from the Nekketsu Kunio Kun universe, each representing different suburbs of Tokyo that compete in an amusement park for the ultimate title. Each character has their unique stats and special moves, which now depend on a power bar that can be charged-up by holding both attack buttons.</desc>

    <desc>This is a soccer game on Neo-Geo. When you start the game, you go into a &quot;Regional Qualifying Round Final&quot; against another team from your region. After beating it, your team goes into the World (Cup) Tournament, in which you are grouped with three other countries in a round-robin. After winning against all of them, you go into an elimination tournament: the quarterfinals, semifinals, and the final for the World Cup. This type of tournament thus is more reminiscent of the real-life World Cup. If a match ends in a draw, you also have the option of replaying a full game, go to the penalty kick tiebreaker, or play a sudden death game.</desc>

    <desc>Tecmo World Soccer &apos;96 is a 2D soccer game. The game has a total of 32 playable teams, each with its own starting formation as well as ratings in three attributes: speed, power, and press. The teams are divided by groups of four into eight world regions: Europe I-IV, North America, South America, Africa, and Asia and Oceania. 

On offense you can perform short or long passes with the A and C buttons, respectively, while the B button performs a scoring kick. While on defense you can manually switch player control with the B button or slide tackle the opposing ball carrier with the A button. Most of the time the game plays like a traditional 2D soccer title, but when the ball carrier and a defending player face off against each other, the game changes into a feinting interface.</desc>

    <desc>Thrash Rally is a fast-paced racing game, similar to Neo Drift Out and Overtop, but using a top-down view. You can either participate in a World Championship or do a complete Paris Dakar rally.
Using basic controls: accelerate with automatic transmission, brake and a combination of both to power drift, you have to follow a set path of courses. In the World Championship, each location consists of different stages that need to be finished in a single run. There is a strict time limit and you receive a time bonus upon finishing a section. The Dakar mode is one long track without stops. The championship uses regular cars, but in the Dakar race you can also choose a sand buggy, off-road bike or a truck.

A global ranking is kept while racing, but it is based on your time, not on the number of cars you pass during the race. Aside from your opponents, you&apos;ll also find water, animals, hills, bridges, bushes and different obstacles in your path.</desc>

    <desc>Viewpoint is a top-down orthographic perspective game in the tradition of Zaxxon. The PlayStation and Saturn versions feature 3D rendered graphics with texture maps, unlike the other versions which primarily feature shaded polygons.

One or two players (in hot-seat or cooperative mode) control a spaceship equipped with a laser cannon which can be charged (by holding the shooting button down) for a stronger blast. Besides the main weapon, three special weapons are available: a wall of fire which wipes the screen up in a wave, a nova-like blast and a circle of spherical-green homing missiles.</desc>

    <desc>Windjammers is based on a real-life sport known as Saucer Tennis or Frisbee Tennis. You and an opponent face off in an arena with a low net in the middle. Points are scored by throwing a disc into the goals behind a player or whenever your opponent is not able to catch the disc in time. There are two moves: a regular throw and a lob. By using quarter-circle movement, you can also add effect to the throw. To catch difficult discs, you can slide to move more quickly. There are six characters to choose from, with specific abilities and their own court fit for their skills. A single game consists of short sets of thirty seconds. The game is won after two winning sets or sudden death after two draws.</desc>

    <desc>You and/or a friend must choose one of three characters to play as, each with different speeds at which they control their ships. Then select three weapons to use for the front and back of your ship. During play, you must travel to every planet in the solar system, and defeat the various enemy ships and the boss near the end of the planet. Your weapons can be upgraded during the battle, and you can also collect HyperBombs if you want to do maximum damage. Contains a nice soundtrack reminiscent of early 1990s &quot;rave&quot; music.</desc>
