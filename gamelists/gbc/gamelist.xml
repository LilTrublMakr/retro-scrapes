    <desc>It seems that an MI-6 agent has been killed just before delivering a report from the Russian Atomic Energy Department.  As James Bond (yes, the James Bond), you&apos;re going to need your license to kill in order to find out who killed him, and return some stolen money to the King.  Based on the 1999 Bond film of the same title, 007: The World Is Not Enough spans 14 levels, each with several objectives.  Using all of the weapons and gadgetry you can get your hands on, you&apos;ll be challenged to upend a terrorist attack, free hostages from a train station, and much more.  To help you in your endeavors, you&apos;ll have access to a bomb disposal kit, digital camera, covert modem, grapple hook watch, night vision glasses, and about a dozen other items of the like.  The game lets you pick your character, your environment, a range of weapons that will be in play, and a scenario.  This adventure offers three different difficulty levels.</desc>

Lording over the game halls in the days after PAC-MAN and DONKEY KONG had lost their luster, these two giants revolutionized gaming forever. JOUST casts you in the role of a noble knight from the future mounting you on an ostrich and sending you off into battle. Making full use of the ostrich, you&apos;ll try to gain altitude and get your opponent from above, collecting magical eggs for extra points. DEFENDER puts you in the pilot&apos;s seat of an aerodynamic space ship and shoots you through the expanses of a futuristic city under siege. You&apos;ll have to fend off other spacecraft, utilize a whole lot of impressive weaponry, and keep the civilians from turning into ugly mutants. Both games are notable for their influence over those to follow, and both are replicated in fine detail for the Game Boys Color. Challenge the computer, or link up and do battle with a friend.</desc>

    <desc>Unlike Activision&apos;s earlier remake of an Atari arcade classic, Battlezone, this one stays close to its namesake.  Take the original, Atari coin-op game Asteroids, add in the features of the Atari 2600 cartridge, then give it 3-D graphics and a bunch of power-ups, and you&apos;ve got Activision&apos;s Asteroids remake.

You are an employee of the Astro-Mining Corporation.  Your mission is to simply go to an assigned area of space and clear the area of asteroids and the occassional debris.  The game consists of five zones, each with a different background and some with special features.  Each zone has 15 levels.  In addition to the standard asteroids, there are also mined asteroids that explode; indestructible asteroids that are, well, indestructible; fireball comets; crystal asteroids that regenerate; alien egg asteroids containing deadly baby space worms; and ancient energy asteroids that shoot back!  And there&apos;s plenty of enemies in addition to the asteroids, such as Standard and Super Saucers, Asteroids Tugs, Fuel Transports, Hexes, Nuke Drivers, and Vulturoids.

There are three types of ships to choose from, each with different strengths and weaknesses.  There are also three skill levels.  If you beat the game at Expert or higher, you gain access to a fourth type of ship.  All ships features the standard laser, shield, flip (instantly flips your ship 180 degrees), and hyperspace.  There are also limited power-ups you can  pick up such as GunSat, Mines, Homing Missiles, Plasma Drill, and Trigger Bombs.

The game supports either one or two players.  In two player mode, the object is to simply outscore your opponent in a random zone and level.  You cannot directly kill your opponent by shooting him, but there are other ways....

Lastly, if you shoot the classic-style asteroid in level 15 of the first zone, you&apos;ll find the option of &quot;Classic Asteroids&quot; now appearing on the main menu.</desc>

    <desc>Being the predecessor of Asterix and Obelix for SNES, this game features the same story as it&apos;s later counterpart - however the level design was massively changed, doesn&apos;t offer a 2 player mode and level codes were added only for the GameBoy Color version.

To show Caesar the power and freedom of your village, you have to collect various trophies from all over Europe. To do this, you can select Asterix or Obelix and move them through various levels while beating up Roman soldiers, collecting coins and avoiding gaps or other obstacles. Various special levels like crossing the sea to Great Britain by boat (and beating up some Romans again) or freeing Rugby players captured by the Romans are scattered across the game and provide variety between the classical Jump &apos;n Run levels. Most levels additionally have a time limit to make things a bit harder, though the difficulty of the game can be adjusted.

There&apos;s an overall of four different countries, all of them based on comic books of the series (namely: Asterix in Britain, Asterix in Switzerland, Asterix at the Olympic Games, Asterix in Spain). At the end of each of these stages you have to contend in a contest typical for the country and also taken from the plot of the comics: In Britannia you take part in a rugby match, in Switzerland you have to blast safes, in Greece you take part in the Olympic games and in Spain you have to fight against (or run from) a bull - victory will get you the desired trophy!</desc>

    <desc>Asterix and Obelix (based on the French comic book series), must embark on a journey from the forests of France to the coliseums of Rome. Their goal is to find Obelix&apos;s lovable pet dog, Dogmatix. Players take control of Asterix or Obelix, and run, jump and punch through various well-drawn and colorful levels in this side-scrolling adventure game.

This title is somewhat non-linear, and allows players to choose the order in which to visit stages, as well as the numerous mini-games. The stage-select screen is a mini-map, and after selecting to play either Asterix or Obelix, players can visit the boss arena, the inn (extra energy, hints and passwords are found here), as well as the the local mini-game. These mini-games become available from the title-screen under the &quot;Instant Fun&quot; option. They vary from a &quot;Memory&quot; style shield-matching game to humorous events such as &quot;Throw a Roman Mini Game&quot;.

Both Asterix and Obelix play differently as they have individual abilities and limitations. Asterix is more nimble, can run faster and jump higher, whereas Obelix is more powerful (being able to bash through some walls) but noticeably slower. These differences are highlighted by the obstacles presented in the stages - there are many jumps to make as well as many enemies (Roman soldiers, boars, centurions) to dispose of. In the quest to find Dogmatix, it is vital to collect keys hidden within the levels to make available new areas. Similarly, it is also important to collect coins from beaten enemies as they allow the purchases at each inn, (which is aptly manned by Getafix himself!).

    <desc>The huge Monster Tower stands near the village Monsbaiya. It is populated by vicious monsters, and few dare enter it. But the monsters in the tower lay eggs, and whoever takes possession of such an egg, can tame a monster which will come out of it, and those monsters, called &quot;familiars&quot;, will help their tamers in times of danger. Some brave adventurers dared to enter the tower and to take the eggs. One of them was called Guy. He was killed in the monster tower. Now his son Koh is fifteen, and he is allowed to try his luck in the tower.

You control Koh and his party of &quot;familiars&quot; in this unusual &quot;monster-taming&quot; RPG. You must capture the eggs from the tower, bring them home, grow monsters and tame them. During battles, you assign different commands to them. Different species have different abilities and need different approach. The battles system is a mixture of real time and turn based combat. Unlike most other console RPGs, there are no special battle screens.</desc>

    <desc>Babe the Pig, of the eponymous movies, was raised by sheepdogs and, hence, believes himself to be a &quot;sheep-pig&quot;, who herds sheep as his foster parents do.  In this game, you control the plucky little porker and direct his sheep management attempts, driving them forward toward the goal in exaggerated, frictionless Soko-Ban or Boulder Dash style with porcine barks until their movement is halted or altered should their course intercept an obstacle such as a fencepost, moveable haystack, pit or trampoline.

Babe is given hints and tips in these efforts by lovable characters from both of his feature films, and the 40 levels borrow inspiration both from the calm pastoral setting of the first and the surreal urban folly of its sequel.  While the measured puzzles are a far cry from the excitement of the movies, the material finds a surprisingly good fit in this unexpected genre -- or otherwise put, &quot;that&apos;ll do, pig.&quot;</desc>

    <desc>Ballistic is a puzzle game in which the player must place 3 patterned balls next to each other in order to clear them. It is somewhat similar to Puyo Puyo in this respect. However Ballistic places the player in the center of the screen shooting the balls outward. In Panic! mode, a constant string of balls appear and the player must keep destroying similar balls to keep the string short and prevent it from snaking around and reaching the middle of the screen. In Checkmate mode, a limited amount of balls are given to the player which they must use to destroy all the balls on the screen. Strategy is used here since the amount of balls destroyed must be maximized.

Ballistic also features a versus mode in which players can challenge one another. Similar to other puzzle games versus modes, one player&apos;s success results in additional balls on the other player&apos;s screen which they then must clear.</desc>

    <desc>Barbie Pet Rescue lets kids play with and care for a variety of domesticated animals. Visit Barbie and her kid sister Stacey at the Pet Rescue Center, where you&apos;ll wait for rescue missions, explore in the playrooms, or tend to pets in the Care Center.

Rescue missions come in over the phone or via e-mail; after learning which pet is missing where, travel with Barbie on her scooter to one of three different environments in which to search for one of eight lost pets. In many missions, you&apos;ll have to figure out how to entice scared animals to come to you, or how to retrieve pets trapped in trees or other sticky situations. If you get stuck yourself, Barbie will give you hints. With each successful mission, you&apos;ll receive a printable Paw &amp; Purr Award that hangs on the Pet Rescue Center wall.

Rescued pets come back to the Pet Rescue Center with you and Barbie to wait for their owners and receive a little TLC. Nurse them back to health in the Care Center, where you&apos;ll give recovered pets water, treats, vitamins and grooming. You may also need to bandage a hurt leg or pick burrs from ruffled fur. After creating a file for them in the computer and giving them a name you select from a list of suggestions, the animals go to one of two playrooms to wait for their owners.

In the meantime, you can play with them, plus all the other pets already in the playroom--a kitten, bunny, hamster, puppy, and a turtle. Select which animal you&apos;d like to pet, then use the cursor to stroke an animal&apos;s head or back or scratch it under the chin. The animals respond to your attention by licking, rolling over, purring, or barking.
 
There is a related mini-game for each kind of animal--Kitten Keepaway, Puppy Treat Toss, Hamster Trail, etc.--and if you do well enough, you&apos;ll see the animal perform a special trick. A few of the games require the use of logic and spatial aptitude, but for the most part they challenge the players&apos; mouse mastery and hand-eye coordination.</desc>

    <desc>The Batman returns on Game Boy Color with BATMAN: Chaos in Gotham City. Based on the popular animated BATMAN series, this single-player action game allows you to don the cowl of one of two Bat-heroes: Batman or Batgirl. Some of the Dark Knight&apos;s famous arch-villains have escaped and are causing serious trouble in Gotham, and it&apos;s up to you to put them back where they belong. Everyone from Poison Ivy to the Clown Prince of Crime the Joker himself is here to wreak havoc and keep the caped crusader busy. Grab your utility belt and assault 18 stages of varied action that take you on a tour of Gotham City. Much of the action is played from a side-scrolling perspective, but some levels have you taking out the Batmobile or the Batcycle in overhead high-speed excitement. Naturally, Batman and Batgirl are both packing their usual assortment of weapons and tools including the Batarang, the grappling hook, smoke bombs, and more.</desc>

Scroll around, punch, kick, play with bat-weapons, and avoid being on the receiving end of those attacks. There are multiple &apos;bat suits&apos; that you can choose from, each with their own special abilities and purposes.

    <desc>Now it&apos;s your turn to sink your opponent&apos;s battleship in this Game Boy Color rendition of the classic strategic board game. Players deploy all four of their ships to different areas on a grid, and take turns firing shots at various parts of their opponent&apos;s grid. Hit each ship the required number of times, and the ship is removed from play. In a unique twist on the classic game, each ship has new weapons. For the solo player, there are 48 missions to complete with animated full-color cutscenes to inspire you to victory! The real challenge however, is taking on a human opponent via a link cable. Forget setting up the board and looking for missing pieces, this is the real way to play Battleship!</desc>

    <desc>In BILLY BOB&apos;S HUNTIN&apos; AND FISHIN&apos; for Game Boy Color, you play the role of a hapless guy named Billy Bob, who is trying to impress a girl. She&apos;ll ask Billy Bob to fetch her rabbits or bass, and it&apos;s up to you to help Billy Bob get them. Obviously, to get the things she wants you&apos;ll have to either go hunting or fishing. Not so fast though, because you need bullets for hunting, bait for fishing, and a license to do either of the two activities. Luckily, you can earn these items by playing a variety of mini-games. The games vary in their gameplay, but the usual assortment of speed and reflex tests are the common thread. You&apos;ll need to clear four mini-games each to go hunting and fishing. Once you&apos;ve finally cleared them and gotten the items you need, you&apos;ll head out to catch your real prize. BILLY BOB&apos;S HUNTIN&apos; AND FISHIN&apos; is for one player and is compatible only with Game Boy Color.</desc>

As a member of the Bionic Corps&apos; Elite Forces team your mission is to infiltrate the Avar installations, disrupt their invasion plans and rescue our scout, fellow bionic commando, Commander Joe. You play a bionic soldier with a mechanic arm that extends and contracts to let you interact with objects normally out of reach.
The game is based on the Bionic Commando arcade game and is a typical platform game with the emphasis on the capabilities your bionic arms gives you. You can use it to swing from platform to platform, pull yourself up onto higher platforms, and attack enemies with it. A few other weapons and a range of pickups is also available. At the start of the game you also get to choose to play a male or female commando.</desc>

The casting is an overhead view with two meters. One is for the direction, but the view for the lure is a side view where the shadow of the fish can be seen as it approaches. It also shows how deep the lure is and how much line is left before it is reeled in.

There are four fish in the game to fish for - trout, pike, catfish and of course the game&apos;s namesake, the black bass.</desc>

    <desc>Game Boy Color version of Boarder Zone is substantially different from its PC namesake.

This version features a pseudo-3D environment, where the camera is positioned behind the boarder and the piste scrolls towards the camera. Obstacles appear on the horizon and increase in size as they near the viewpoint.

The two main game modes are &apos;Competition&apos; and &apos;Challenge&apos;.

Competition features a &apos;race attack&apos; mode (basically a speed race with another AI player), Trick Attack (trick points based over 5 courses, beating a course threshold to advance), Time Attack (best time), and Supreme Attack (race with tricks).

Challenge modes is about beating any previous records set for a particular track and supported Time Attack (best time), Trick Attack (best trick points), Slalom Attack (time on a flag course), and Vs Race (which uses the Game Boy Universal Link Cable).

There is also a practice mode and a &apos;ghost boarder&apos; - basically a replay of the player&apos;s best race.

Trick moves include Mute Grab, Nose Grab, Tweak, Stiffy, Indy Air, Tail Grab, Stalefish, Shifty Air, Meloncholy, Frontside Air, Backside Air, 180, 360, 540, 720, 900, 1080, Front Flip, Back Flip, Rodeo Flip, and McTwist; most of which are performed with combo style control moves.

The player can choose from four characters: Sandy, Travis, Alain, and Tara.</desc>

    <desc>Bomberman returns to the Game Boy Color. The adventure is much the same as before, plant bombs to blow up blocks and enemies that get in your way of the exit. 

Much like Pokémon before it, Max: Blue is one part of the adventure (the other being Max: Red Challenger Edition). During both games, you can pick up &quot;Charabombs&quot;, creatures that you can raise as your own, and fight against other players Charabombs. It&apos;s a simple bonus game of Rock/Paper/Scissors, but the only way to complete the entire adventure is by linking both games together via link cable and pass over levels from one cart to the other, as each game has unique levels, so as to collect all of the Charabombs.

In Max: Blue you play as Bomberman himself, with all of the classic graphics and sounds that have been part of the series from the start.</desc>

    <desc>The second half of the Bomberman Max series, Red Challenger is much the same as Blue Champion in terms of the tasks at hand for the main character. However, instead of playing as Bomberman, you play as Max, who still is much the same as Bomberman except for looks. The graphics are also slightly different for each level compared to Blue.

The task stays the same, plant bombs to destroy blocks and enemies in your way, as well as collecting Charabombs, creatures who act much the same as Pokémon where you raise the Charabombs and fight against other players. Certain Charabombs and levels are only available in Blue, so you must link with another Game Boy and the Blue Champion Edition to collect all of the Charabombs and complete the adventure.</desc>

    <desc>Carrying with him all the monsters he captured on his last mission, Bomberman is headed for his home planet Bomber. However, all of a sudden someone steals all of his four rocket engines and he is forced to make an emergency landing. After having woken up from the crash he realises that not only are his engines gone, but all of the monsters have escaped!

Bomberman Quest is a top down action RPG in which Bomberman has to traverse four different lands and speak to the natives to aid him in his quest to reclaim the engines and monsters. In true action RPG fashion, you pick up upgrades along the way, such as bomb parts and skills acquired from defeating monsters.

There is also a battle mode where two players can duke it out via linked Game Boy Colors.</desc>

    <desc>A Bug&apos;s Life is a platform game with different goals in each of 15 levels. Most of the goals deal with getting the main character, Flik, to do events that match the storyline of the movie. When the player finishes a level, that player can proceed to the next level. Each new level starts with a new short animation from the movie. If the player collects all of the bonus items in a level, that player gets a bonus movie. Bonus items include 50 pieces of grain, four letters that spell F-L-I-K (like the Tarzan N64 game) and permanently finishing off each enemy bug. To guide the player through the levels there are little floating telescopes that will show the player areas where he is supposed to go. Throughout each level are a variety of types of seeds. Some seeds are partially buried in the ground. These seeds can be transformed by Flik into a specific kind of plant that can help him solve problems within the levels. Flik can increase the number of plants he can grow by collecting colored tokens scattered throughout the levels, with a token&apos;s color determining what type of plant can be grown with it. Some levels also included Flikâs harvesting invention (hidden somewhere in the level) which can be used to collect grain and kill off enemy bugs.</desc>

    <desc>Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle brings the gameplay from Bugs Bunny in Crazy Castle and its sequel to the Game Boy Color. In the game you play as Bugs Bunny and you have to find a treasure hidden in an old castle.

Coyote) under a spell and they will try anything to prevent you from reaching your goal.

You will have to guide Bugs Bunny through 60 levels in and around the castle. In each level you have to find eight keys to unlock the door to the next level.

You can collect carrots for more lives and there are a variety of weapons you can pick up to take care of your enemies, including bombs, lightning, cork gun, juice and weights. Other items such as a hammer or pick-axe can help you get past level obstacles. Shields, clocks and shoes will protect you from your enemies.

As Bugs Bunny you can walk around, climb stairs, use elevators and climb through tunnels to navigate around the screen.</desc>

CPU has two different modes: Story mode sees a story unfold as you defeat each CPU character (and changes depending on the character you start with) and Win Contest is a simple &quot;how many games can I win in a row&quot; against the computer. Finally, if you complete the Challenge mode (where you must complete certain puzzels as fast as possible, and get judged on technique, speed etc.) the Edit mode will become available. In here you can put together your own puzzles for you or your friends to complete.</desc>

    <desc>Guide a team of up to four soldiers through 72 levels of combat in this innovative top-down action/strategy hybrid, best thought of as Lemmings crossed with Commando crossed with Dune 2. The characters are controlled indirectly using the mouse, as you activate each soldier or group of them by highlighting them, click the left button to move them to a particular spot, and the right button for them to fire guns at an enemy. You can also pick up grenades, which can be used to destroy groups of enemies or buildings (by pressing both buttons at once). 

Each mission has a specific objective, and some feature vehicles such as tanks to make things easier. Your troops can cross water but can&apos;t shoot within it, so finding and controlling bridges is often crucial. You can use the arrangement of trees to find hiding places to shoot from, and should watch out for CPU soldiers also doing so.</desc>

Part of the small but popular virtual pet genre, CATZ lets you adopt a cat from one of three breeds: Siamese, Calico, or Persian. You can play with the pet first to decide if it&apos;s right for you. Once you&apos;ve adopted the little gal or fella, it&apos;s up to you to take care of it: feed it, groom it, and play with it regularly if you want it to grow up to be a well-adjusted adult. If you mistreat your cat, your little pet will take off, never to return! Eventually, new breeds of cats and new special toys will become available for you, depending on how well you do. You can also trade toys and breeds of cats with your friends via the infrared link.</desc>

Once you have placed the agents, you must guide one of them toward the suspect vehicle. If the vehicle goes outside the city, the game is over.

Once the two of you make contact, the battle begins where the object is to ram the suspect&apos;s vehicle until it is disabled. You can also shoot the vehicle to further damage it, and use up to three turbos to catch up with the vehicle if you happen to fall behind.</desc>

    <desc>Prepare to challenge the longest running console chess series, THE CHESSMASTER. In this Game Boy version of the game, you can choose to play at any one of 16 different skill levels, ranging from beginner to expert. For those just learning to play chess, take advantage of the Teaching mode that will show you all of the best moves to make. This game has a variety of options for chess fans, as you can set up the board however you like to simulate classic chess situations and challenges. You can even make your opponent?s pieces invisible for an added challenge. If you make a wrong move, the game will allow you to take back moves and try again. If you?d rather just see the outcome, merely ask THE CHESSMASTER and he?ll finish the game to checkmate. Play alone or against a friend through the use of the Game Boy Link Cable. You can also use the password function to resume a game already in progress.</desc>

    <desc>This version of Chicken Run is far different from its console counterparts and is loosely based on the movie itself.  This version&apos;s gameplay is geared more towards Lemmings where the player takes control of the main protagonists, Rocky and Ginger, and leads their fellow chickens out of dangerous situations by collecting bags of feed scattered throughout the stage and use the corn to lay a path around obstacles and traps to the stage&apos;s exit.

It features over 24 levels, ranging from the chicken coup to the dreaded pie machine and features obstacles such as cameras, dogs, spotlights and many more.  Players can also use common household items scattered throughout the level to aid the player in deactivating various traps and help spring their fellow chickens from certain doom.</desc>

    <desc>Blue Dino has become ill, and its up to Green Dino to find a cure. Essentially a remake of the classic arcade title, without the ability to play with two players.

The aim of the game is to use your Dino&apos;s bubble abilities to trap and pop the bad guys while dodging their attacks to complete the level, collecting the bonus items along the way. Popping the enemies turns them into fruit for bonus points.</desc>

    <desc>Conker has a party with his girlfriend. The Evil Acorn breaks up the party. The Acorn takes Conker&apos;s girlfriend. Now Conker must rescue his girlfriend. The game also worked for Game Boy and Super Game Boy. 

Conker travels through many levels, trying to find presents that the Evil Acorn has stolen. Conker is equipped with a slingshot to battle enemies, such as mutant plants, snakes, and others. Players encounter a few minigames on their adventure, including olympic-type games. If a player started on Game Boy, they had to play through the game before they could play on Game Boy Color. This worked the other way around, also.</desc>

You travel across 48 levels in this free roaming 3D game. You have to beat all the levels in a village (except the secret level) to move on to the next one. In each village, (except the 4th village) are 5 regular levels, 2 bosses, and 1 secret level. Regular levels are levels where you just beat them and get certain items in them.

Bosses are levels where you go through one section then fight a monster at the end. Secret levels are levels where you collect the jigsaw piece. Once you collect the jigsaw piece in all 4 secret levels and defeat Baron Dante, Swap Meet Pete will take you to the lost levels.</desc>

    <desc>The sequel to Cruis&apos;n World both in the arcades and on Nintendo 64, Cruis&apos;n Exotica lets you race against the computer or up to three other opponents in a wide variety of cars and locales. Game mechanics follow &quot;arcade&quot; rules, which include &quot;turbos&quot; to accelerate to (and raise) maximum speed, and any deviation off of the track bumps you right back on it.

Cars range from sportcars to more esoteric cars like trucks, minis, and police vehicles. Tracks model real life (Alaska, India, Korea, etc.) and eventually branch out into fantasy worlds (Atlantis, Amazon, Mars).</desc>

    <desc>Acclaim&apos;s foray into trick-based BMX games spawned a unique version for the Game Boy Color.

The basic design is the same as in the original console title and other post-Tony Hawk extreme sports games. In career mode, the player has to complete various goals in each level to advance and unlock further levels. These goals include reaching a certain score through tricks and combos, performing special tricks, or collecting items. The eight levels (shown in isometric perspective) are filled with half- and quarter pipes, ramps, rails and many obstacles to perform tricks on. Two dozen different tricks are available through various button combinations, some of which must be unlocked first by finding tokens in the levels.

In training mode, unlocked levels can be practiced without the time limit present in career mode.

The game also offers a multiplayer mode, where up to four players can take turns on a single GBC and the player with the highest score or the best trick combo wins.</desc>

    <desc>The popular pursuit of hunting comes to the portable screen in DEER HUNTER for the Game Boy Color. You play as a hunter looking to catch a nice trophy in one of four different areas using three different weapons. Hunt deer with a shotgun, a rifle, or a bow, using slightly different tactics with each. If you want to be successful, you&apos;ll have to use real-world hunting strategies. Search for droppings or other signs of movement to find the best area to wait in. Once there, use one of an assortment of tools to help you catch your prey: mask your odor with a cover scent, use a tree stand to camouflage yourself, or lure the deer with a powerful musk, a deer call, or an antler rattle. It&apos;s up to you to decide how to catch the deer; some methods are more efficient than others, so you&apos;ll have to find the one that works best for you. Detailed graphics and digitized sound round out the experience for would-be hunters.</desc>

    <desc>Cruella De Vil has captured more Dalmatian puppies to make into a coat. You, as Domino or Oddball, must free them.

Disney&apos;s 102 Dalmatians: Puppies to the Rescue on the Game Boy Color is a 2D, side-scrolling platform game. You must run and jump about the level, searching for a key. Once you have the key, you then go to each cage to open it and free the puppies. When all puppies are free, you will get a password and move to the next level. Try to avoid the enemy toys that move about as they will damage you. You can use your bark to stun a toy but that is temporary.</desc>

    <desc>The game from Virgin based on the 1992 animated Disney film is a side-scrolling platformer.

The player controls Aladdin, who must make his way through several levels based on locations from the movie: from the streets and rooftops of Agrabah, the Cave of Wonders and the Sultan&apos;s dungeon to the final confrontation in Grand Vizier Jafar&apos;s palace. The Sultan&apos;s guards and also animals of the desert want to hinder Aladdin in his way. He can defend himself with his sword or by throwing apples. Next to apples, Aladdin can also collect gems which can be traded for lives and continues with a traveling trader. Finding Genie or Abu icons enables bonus rounds. The Genie bonus round is a game of luck played for apples, gems or extra lives. In Abu&apos;s bonus round, the player controls the little monkey who has to catch bonus items that fall from the sky, but without touching any of the unwanted objects like rocks and pots.

The game&apos;s humorous animations were created by Walt Disney Feature Animation.</desc>

    <desc>Are you looking to adopt a pet but lack the time or space to take care of a real one? Then you may find DOGZ to be of interest. Part of the small but popular virtual pet genre, DOGZ lets you adopt a dog from one of three breeds: Chihuahua, Scottie, or mutt. You can play with the pet first to decide if it&apos;s right for you. Once you&apos;ve adopted the little gal or fella, it&apos;s up to you to take care of it: feed it, groom it, and play with it regularly if you want it to grow up to be a well-adjusted adult. If you mistreat your dog, though, your little pet will take off! Eventually, new breeds of dogs and new special toys will become available for you, depending on how well you do. You can even trade toys and breeds of dogs with your friends via the infrared link.</desc>

    <desc>You play as Donald in this 3D platform action game. Donald&apos;s girlfriend, Daisy is a reporter for a television station in Duckberg. While doing a story on the secret temple of the terrible magician Merlock, Daisy is kidnapped. Now, it is up to Donald to get her back. Along the way he will have help from his nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, and the inventor Gyro Gearloose. He will also have competition from Gladstone Gander, who is also trying to save Daisy. 

Game play alternates between side-scrolling running and jumping and 3D running and jumping. The side-scrolling levels play a lot like the Super Mario Bros. games. The 3D levels are more akin to the Crash Bandicoot series of games. All in all, there are 20 levels spread out through various areas.</desc>

    <desc>King K. Rool has stolen Donkey Kong&apos;s banana stash, and Donkey Kong needs your help to get them back. In search of K. Rool, the Kremling horde impedes your progress. Kremlings, crocodile-like creatures, include Kritters (they succumb to a simple jump on the head), Krushas (they are virtually indestructible), and others. There are also other enemies that block your path, such as beavers, snakes, vultures. Leading them are dastardly bosses, including Very Gnawty, Necky, Bumble B, and Dumb Drum, and they all bar the way with their own special blend of villainy.

Donkey Kong is joined by Diddy Kong: these two primates differ significantly. For example, Donkey Kong is generally stronger; he can destroy most enemies with a single jump and can lift barrels straight over his head to throw them farther. On the other hand, Diddy is faster and not as strong as Donkey; he can run really fast and do cartwheels. Diddy carries barrels in front of him, creating a shield against frontal attacks.

The game is split into different worlds, which are split into different levels. Each level contains bonus areas, where one can collect bananas, medallions, and lives. At the end of each world is a boss, which is usually a larger version of a minor enemy.</desc>

This GBC conversion of the 1983 arcade classic is just about complete, minus one or two pieces of animation here and there, as well as a few sound files, replaced with MIDI alternatives. But the gameplay stays the same, control and press the right buttons at the same time to continue the movie, until Dirk defeats all evil standing in his way of Princess Daphne.</desc>

    <desc>In Driver, the driving (pun intended) force of the world is crime. The main character, an ex-race car driver, takes on the role of an undercover cop. It seems your superior officer has decided to put your talents to the test. He orders you to infiltrate the local mob group, and to help bring it down from the inside. As a result, the game takes place from the perspective of a low-level gang member. The action speeds into a number of different cities, ranging from San Francisco to Miami. It is on the streets that the main part of the game will take place. 

Basically, Driver is broken into a number of mini-missions. In total, over 30 different challenges await the persistent gamer. The missions are divided between the various locales of the game. The different assignments will each require a special tactic. As an example, consider the mission in which the objective is to destroy an enemy getaway vehicle. In such a situation, the primary goal is to keep an eye on the target and ram it into submission. If the orders are to pick up a gang member within a time limit, speed and secrecy become of utmost importance. If the cops see the exchange, the badges will be on you like glue. Each situation will require a measure of thought and intelligence. 

Driver also offers a couple of extra side games. The survival mode sets the player against a horde of maniacal police officers. The crazed cops will do anything to smash you into submission. The result is a race through the city with a bunch of cops on your tail. It is a test of endurance. In the getaway mode, the idea is to flee for safety from the encroaching stiffs. The game places you in an area of the city, with a cop on your tail. Your only goal is to avoid the authorities. Be careful, though, as the cops may set up a roadblock to impede your progress.

Driver is designed with the Game Boy Color in mind. It offers a password save system to keep your data under wraps.</desc>

    <desc>Dropzone was the first game to propel Archer Maclean to stardom. The game, originally written for the 8-bit Ataris, is basically a Defender clone, but popular because it so closely recreates the gameplay of the original Defender, with its speedy scrolling and frantic gameplay.

The player is a spaceman with a jet-pack, flying across a barren landscape whose skies are inhabited by a number of different aliens; from the simple Planter to the slowly advancing Blunder Storm or the quick, aggressive Nemesite. 

Planters and Nemesites will try to pickup the small men walking on the surface, who must then be rescued. You must shoot down the alien, while avoiding to hit the man. Sometimes, the aliens will carry an android, which is similar to the human but deadly. Care must be taken so as to not pick up the androids. All men must be transported to a surface base, where they are put in safety. This is the Dropzone.</desc>

    <desc>Duke Nukem is back in this self-titled game. Duke Nukem has become famous and because of that attracted the attention of the alien Zorgonites. The Zorgonites want to abduct Duke to let him lead their armies to conquer the universe.

Duke Nukem on the Game Boy Color is a classical jump and run platform game where you can walk, shoot, jump, climb ladders, hang from ledges, crawl, but also mount vehicles such as a little tank and space ship. You have to avoid enemies and hazardous environments. Levels will bring you on board a Zorgonite spaceship, the moon, LA and other locations.

The game features 12 usable weapons, including a flame thrower, bazooka and machine gun. Other power-ups include body armor, health packs and bonus lives.</desc>

    <desc>If you have any doubt as to E.T.&apos;s ability to help you get organized, witness the stunning efficiency with which he expressed his desperate need to make a phone call. There&apos;s no need for a separate digital organizer anymore, as you can now keep track of your life on a Game Boy Color. Everyone&apos;s favorite little alien being provides a calendar, an address book, a working clock, and even a &quot;to-do&quot; list that will keep young science fiction fans motivated and productive. There are even five mini-games included, several of which involves helping the titular mascot evade the authorities and collect the necessary items to construct an inter-global telephone system. One of the games challenges you to raise a &quot;Flopgopple&quot; pet, and all of the options are compatible with the Nintendo Game Boy Printer. Kids can even protect all of their personal data with the use of an original password. Now, that&apos;s organization.</desc>

    <desc>As long-time fans of the classic film know, it&apos;s not easy being a visitor on another planet. This handheld game for the GBC closely mirrors the plot of Steven Spielberg&apos;s 1982 classic science fiction masterpiece, putting you in the shoes of E.T. or his human friend, Elliot. Of course, the game&apos;s main objective is to collect the parts necessary to construct an interplanetary communicator that E.T. can use to &quot;phone home.&quot; All the while, Earth-based authorities will try to apprehend you, so make sure you bring your wits and reflexes to the table. There are 45 quests in all, each of which presents new traps and obstacles to avoid, and the game even has three separate difficulty levels to master. With six main game areas and 10 detailed environments, E.T. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL: Escape from Planet Earth has unusually high replay value, wonderful graphics, and more gameplay than you can shake a stick at.</desc>

    <desc>What would you do if someone turned you into a llama? Based on the animated film from Disney, THE EMPEROR&apos;S NEW GROOVE casts you in the role of a young Incan ruler named Kuzco. When the evil Yzma turns Kuzco into a llama, our hero must make his way through eight action-packed levels in order to return to his archenemy for the ultimate showdown. That will require jumping gaps, negotiating moving platforms, breaking down barriers, unlocking closed doors, and more. Of course, all of Yzma&apos;s dastardly minions will be after you, but you&apos;ll have a variety of attacks to thwart their efforts including spitting! Along your path, you&apos;ll collect red and gold coins, water jugs, and plenty of Aztec coins. There&apos;ll be lots of obstacles along the way (watch out for scorpions!), but with your wits, skills, and reflexes, you might just have a chance at defeating your enemies and returning to the life that&apos;s rightfully yours. Good luck, llama!</desc>

    <desc>F-1 World Grand Prix is a Formula 1 racing game for the Game Boy Color, based on the Nintendo 64 title. The Game Boy Color iteration features an official license of the 1998 season and thus all 11 authentic teams, drivers and tracks from that year. Unlike the Nintendo 64 version the game is completely in 2D and is viewed from a 3rd person perspective.

The game tries to deliver the most realistic racing experience on a handheld of its time. You can manually adjust many aspects of the car before each race, such as transmission, gear, and tyre types and the alignment of your spoilers.

The game features five playing modes (Grand Prix, Exhibition, Challenge, Time Trial and Two Player), two difficulty settings and allows for three separate save games. You can turn damage and different weather types on and off.</desc>

    <desc>Supersonic jet dogfighting comes to the small screen in F-18 THUNDERSTRIKE for the Game Boy Color. In this one-player flight sim, you take the role of a daring pilot who&apos;s flying an elite fighter jet. Slide into an inside-the-cockpit view, battle against multiple enemies, and practice your aerial combat and evasion maneuvers to prove your air superiority. You can play in either Arcade or Simulation mode, each affording you a unique experience. Arcade mode offers looser controls that make things easier for rookie pilots, while experts will want to jump right into Simulation mode, which will challenge the ability of even the most experienced flyboy. Head into multiple missions of dogfighting action and perform aerial tricks that will break the sound barrier, but don&apos;t think that it&apos;s all fun and games. When the mission&apos;s complete, you&apos;ll have to carefully land your jet on an aircraft carrier.</desc>

    <desc>The Game Boy Color version of Stars 2001 is very loosely based on the PC/Playstation game with the same name. Much of what made the original special is gone. For example, the whole concept of Star Points, which was such an important part of the console game has been removed. Left is a football game with a quite ordinary style. Due to the Premier League license all twenty teams are real and have real world players (16 in each team). The gameplay resembles the style of many classic games in the genre and is viewed from an top down perspective. Play modes available are friendly match, full season or a custom league of the players&apos; choice.</desc>

    <desc>Brace yourself for a soccer game that brings all of the wild fun of soccer home on your Game Boy Color! FIFA 2000 is a fully-licensed soccer game that has more than 60 teams from around the world with updated rosters appropriate to the 2000 season. You can choose to play one of five different gameplay modes. Exhibition mode is a quick game where you set the teams and the rules then hit the field. In Tournament mode, you&apos;ll square off against an assortment of other teams to see who can take home the final victory. Playoff mode has you playing the final teeth-to-the-grindstone matches where every victory counts. In League mode, you&apos;ll play through a full season that culminates in the playoffs to see who is the greatest. Finally, Indoor mode takes the game inside and changes up the rules a little bit, resulting in a fast-paced version of the original. Options available for every mode include weather settings, foul settings, wind, and more. You can also use the password to save all of your stats in League and Tournament modes.</desc>

    <desc>The restaurant business meets prehistoric times in this combination of classic video gaming and old-fashioned cartoon mayhem. Mr. Slate has purchased himself a Brontoburger chain, and Fred has been saddled with the unenviable task of playing chef. It seems that the restaurant has come with a pre-existing problem, though: pests! Run from counter to counter, trying to build sandwiches for the hungry customers, avoiding attacks from the flying beasties all the while. Interestingly, the kitchen is also outfitted with a bunch of platforms and ladders which means you&apos;ll have your share of climbing to tackle as well. Lose all of your lives and you&apos;re out of a job (resulting in more time at home with the ingratiating Bam-Bam). The graphics and humor are perfect representations of the original cartoon, and the game plays much like the coin-operated BURGERTIME. Play alone or use a link cable to hook up with a friend to see who has the fastest food preparation skills in Bedrock.</desc>

    <desc>Your task in this arcade conversion is to guide a frog across a treacherous road and river, and to safety at the top of the screen. Both these sections are fraught with a variety of hazards, each of which will kill the frog and cost you a life if contact is made.

The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the snakes which hover within on later levels. Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles (which are only there for a short time) and alligators (but stay away form their faces), and then jump into one of the open home-cells, ideally one containing a fly for extra points. Once all holes have been filled, you move onto the next, harder, level.</desc>

    <desc>Godzilla: The Series is based off the TV show on Fox, which was in turn based off the 1998 film starring Matthew Broderick. In this game, the player takes control of the big guy himself as giant monsters from space have invaded Earth and are determined to destroy it. Unfortunately for both the aliens and Godzilla the military is out to destroy both, so Godzilla now has to fight off the military to throw back the alien menace.

There are seven levels in all. The player will travel through each level destroying the military to reach the end of the level and fight the boss monster. The only control the player has over Godzilla is his attacks as Godzilla will walk on his own from left to right on the screen in a linear path. There are four attacks to choose from: Stomp, Bite, Tail-Whip and the famous Radiation Breath.</desc>

    <desc>The GameBoy Color version of Gold and Glory: The Road to El Dorado is a side-scrolling platformer that follows the main events of the animated movie.

Through many levels you control one of two main characters: Tulio or Miguel. They can walk, run, jump, climb, collect objects, and use cutlasses. In most levels you should proceed from one part of level to another collecting a certain number of items, sometimes significant ones such as parts of a map showing the way to El Dorado. Different opponents will try to prevent your progress, but they can be either avoided or eliminated.

Different arcade sequences such as running away from a bull or riding a horse as well as several battles with bosses are present. Such encounters include fights with a cougar, Cortez himself, and also playing Indian basketball against the Indian champion.</desc>

    <desc>In Grand Theft Auto, the player takes the role of a small-time criminal trying to make it big with the mob. Stealing cars, doing jobs for the gangsters and behaving generally anti-social are the way to success.

The action moves through six levels spread over three different cities, each based on a real US city: Liberty City (based on New York City), San Andreas (based on San Francisco) and Vice City (based on Miami). To finish a level, a certain score must be reached. Stealing cars and crashing into traffic, driving over pedestrians and killing cops all raise the score, but the 
big points are made through jobs. Answering phones or entering special cars brings mission assignments, from simple &quot;ditch-a-hot-car&quot; jobs to supporting bank robberies or carrying out assassinations. Completing a mission will raise the score substantially and also increase the score multiplier, so that completing the next felony will gain even more points.

Criminal behavior comes with a price of course: if policemen witness a crime, the player&apos;s wanted level rises. At the lowest level, a single police car might give chase, whereas at the highest level whole car squads hunt the player, the police set up roadblocks and shoot to kill. The only way to evade the cops is to find a respray shop and get a new paint job with new license plates. This costs money which is deducted from the score, however. But even dying or being arrested are not the end. The player has several lives, and ending up in jail simply results in being stripped of all weapons and armor and the score multiplier being lowered.

The entire action is viewed from a top-down perspective, which zooms out while driving a car, for a better overview at high speeds. The cities are many screens large and can be freely explored. Crates are scattered over the cities, which might include weapons (from pistols to rocket launchers), armor or other bonus items: extra lives, police bribes (used to reduce the wanted level to zero) and get-out-of-jail-free cards (used to retain score multiplier and weapons when busted). Dozens of different vehicles are available for the taking, each with unique characteristics: a bus will handle very differently than a sports car.</desc>

    <desc>As the young Sebastian, gamers take the role of the son of a brilliant scientist who has discovered a means to travel through time. Time travel has already taken place in this reality, however, and Sebatian&apos;s first mission is to use his father&apos;s discovery to return to the past and destroy an earlier time machine, which upset the balance of power in a past war and led to dangerous realities in their present. Just as Sebastian enters the machine to travel back to the past, he watches helplessly as his father is kidnapped and taken prisoner.

You play as Sebastian, the soldier sent back in time to rectify the present. Hands of Time features an overhead view and six levels, each of which is comprised of a small overworld with various objectives. Much of the game requires completing item-swapping sequences in order to progress, while avoiding enemy soldiers along the way. You have a small pistol with infinite ammo. You can collect better weapons, though their ammo is limited. There are no difficulty levels and no multiplayer; you can jump to any of the six levels by use of a password system.</desc>

Each bike is rated in acceleration, top speed, and handling so you can pick one that fits your riding style. You can go for a high-speed, low-acceleration model, or if you prefer to burn rubber off of the line, you will want to choose a bike with monster acceleration. When you are ready to ride you will have the opportunity to race on four different tracks including the Arizona Desert, Deep South, Florida Everglades, and California Coast. On all of the tracks you will have to race from sunrise to sunset in order to emerge victorious. Get on your hog and cruise the good olâ U.S. of A in HARLEY DAVIDSON: Race Across America.</desc>

    <desc>The second Harry Potter role-playing game follows directly on from the first, with mostly the same game mechanics, controls and even some of the graphics.

To unravel the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets, young wizard Harry Potter must fight turn-based battles and solve quests. In this game, he is not alone, as a party system was added: his friends Ron and Hermione (and some other characters) will join Harry in the battles. While Harry (as in the previous game) can use card combinations of Famous Witches and Wizards cards to produce special attacks and effects, his friends have other means: Ron can unleash his rat Scabbers in special rat attacks and Hermione, being the know-it-all that she is, influences combat through &quot;lecture attacks&quot;, using helpful hints like &quot;Be Careful!&quot; (which increases defense, for example).

Gone is the potion-mixing from the first game, but aside from the party system, several other features were added: the Informous spell divulges information about strengths and weaknesses of enemies, which is stored and can be accessed later. To aid in finding one&apos;s way around Hogwarts, floor maps were added.

Like the first game, this one also includes several mini-games, including Quidditch, that once found in the game can be accessed from the main menu.

    <desc>In the first Harry Potter game for the Game Boy Color, the story of Harry&apos;s first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is told in the form of a traditional role-playing game.

Playing as Harry, one advances through the plot of the book and the movie by fulfilling quests, battling monsters and gaining experience and levels.

Combat is turn-based, with Harry being able to use a variety of spells against various critters and other enemies. In addition, card combinations of Famous Witches and Wizards Collector&apos;s Cards can be used to produce powerful magical effects. These cards can be found all over the freely explorable Hogwarts. Potions that refill stamina and magic points can be found, bought or mixed by Harry himself, but only with the right ingredients.

As in other Potter games, Harry also competes for house points for Gryffindor, hoping to win the House Cup in the end.

The game features several mini-games that, once found in the main game, can also be accessed from the main menu.</desc>

    <desc>After much acclaim for your past farming accomplishments (as part of the previous Harvest Moon titles on GBC), you are asked by a young girl to help her get her farm up and running. The farm, situated on an island, needs plenty of work, so you need all your skills to get things working correctly.

Your many tasks range from tending to the farm animals, keeping an eye on the budget while purchasing goods (food, water, mechanical items, etc) at the local stores, and so forth. And although the main aim is to build and maintain the farm, there are plenty of opportunities to take care of yourself (go to the movies, buy pets, find a girlfriend/boyfriend).</desc>

    <desc>Harvest Moon is a farming simulator/RPG where you must build and maintain a farm during the course of a year, while taking care of your budget and yourself. 

You have the ability to buy, sell and take care of farm animals, crops and any other supplies that you may have. You can trade with many of the town&apos;s people, and fellow farmers. If you link up a friend&apos;s Game Boy, you can trade items between players as well.

The local stores supply plenty of items to help you in your quest, at a cost, of course. And if you have the time, you can go about the town in search of a little fun away from work.

From an overhead perspective, you can explore your farming area, the local town and the Harvest Sprite tunnels, full of strange and wonderful creatures that can help or destroy your quest. There are four seasons (Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring) and each brings with it new challenges such as keeping arm animals warm during the colder seasons, and supplying water to the crops during the warmer periods.

The GBC version includes all new characters and background sprites in full color, but is also backwards compatible with the original Game Boy version.</desc>

However, you can only tell Kitty to move left or right, and if you are not careful, Kitty will fall off the edge and say hello to the grim reaper. Luckily, blocks fall from the sky, which can be rotated and used to create staircases and bridges to the objects. However, placing three blocks with identical colors next to each other will make them disappear; this can both help and hurt. In addition to the block problems, Badz Maru, Hanamaru, and Pandaba will wander around and cause problems for Hello Kitty. Can you handle the pressure and collect all of the items in HELLO KITTY&apos;S CUBE FRENZY?</desc>

    <desc>Hexcite is a puzzle game played on a honeycomb-like playing field. In the center is a hexagon; six more hexagons make up the entire playing field. Because of the turn-based gameplay, two people can play using only one system. Two-player link mode is also supported.

Players begin by placing a geometric shape (triangle, hexagon, parallelogram, etc.) in the center hexagon.  The CPU or human opponent then places another shape adjacent (and touching completely on one side) to a previously played piece.  Players score bonus points for completing any full hexagon. Much of the strategy in this game is in tricking your opponent into letting you take a bonus. Bonuses are also scored for placing a piece so that two sides will contribute a score. The game is over when all pieces have been played, or if the remaining pieces cannot be played.  In that case points are subtracted for any remaining pieces, based on the complexity of the shape (twice as many points are subtracted for a hexagon compared to a triangle.)

In Japan, this game has seen several Windows versions, and even has been released as a board game.</desc>

    <desc>It&apos;s a quiet day on the links. You tee up your ball, and drive it 200 yards down the center of the fairway, leaving a 150-yard approach shot. After taking the approach shot, the ball stops rolling 3-feet from the pin. On the green, you sink the relatively easy putt, and you start your round with a birdie. While most golfers never have days like this, they can with HOLE IN ONE GOLF. Get out on three different courses and try to get the lowest score possible. However, the courses are located in rural areas, so you never know when birds, squirrels, or bears will come onto the course and mess with your shots. Try to play the round of your life with HOLE IN ONE GOLF.</desc>

    <desc>Whereas the other versions of Indiana Jones&apos; first game in nearly a decade are 3D action adventures inspired by Tomb Raider, this edition is different, being viewed from above in pseudo-3D with multi-directional movement. The plot involves Communists attempting to rebuild an ancient time machine, whose pieces are spread across 19 levels. 

There are largely-switch-based puzzles to solve on each one, and different routes through to completing them. Indy is variously armed with a pistol, machine gun, grenades and his ubiquitous whip. Each level has a password, and ends with a clip advancing the story. As well as Soviets, your foes include scorpions, snakes and jellyfish.</desc>

The game is played from a non-scrolling side view, with your attacks being determined by combinations of the attack buttons and the directional arrows. As mentioned you win matches via points awarded whenever you connect a direct hit or perform a successful move. 

The GBC version also adds a health bar that influences your performance and a round-based system. Furthermore all graphics have been redrawn and the character selection has been expanded and now includes 12 playable characters, each from a different location.</desc>

    <desc>International Superstar Soccer 99 is a soccer game for the Game Boy Color. You can play a 1 player match, 2 players match or play an international cup. The game doesn&apos;t feature an official license so all player names in the game only closely resemble real player names. There are 32 national teams to play with.

When you are in the defense you can make a sliding and switch players. While in offense you can make a pass or a shot. While the ball is in the air it is possible to make a header or bicycle kick.

The game is displayed from the side of the field, except during penalties, when the camera is aimed directly at the goal.</desc>

    <desc>This to-go version of Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000 is a top-down racing game, featuring two game modes (championship and arcade), 6 bikers and a variety of tracks in different scenarios.

Season mode features 3 championships, each with three stages composed of four races. The goal is to win all 9 gold medals by obtaining more points than the competition. Arcade mode is the same, except all championships and stages, as well as Jeremy McGrath, are unlocked from the start.
The difference between championships is the engine size - with larger (thus faster) bikes, the player has less time to react, and going head to head into the edge of the track can be a matter of a simple bump in 80cc to a spectacular flip into the stands in 250cc, also because it becomes a lot harder to do sharp turns in a limited space.

While it can be played as a straightforward racing game, by performing tricks the player can obtain some powerups - a bomb will knock down the next opponent, the arrow temporarily boosts bike stats and the shield allows the player to barge into one opponent, knocking him off his bike. There is one big catch - the skull and bones knock the player out of his bike, which can prove to be decisive in a close race.</desc>

    <desc>Keep the balance! is a puzzle game, where you have to balance a big weighing scale. The longer it stays in balance the more point you gain. To do this, you have a catapult at your disposal, the objects you need to use to balance the scale are given to you by conveyor belt. One on the left and one on the right. But these objects differ in weight, so you must carefully choose the scales bucket you&apos;re going to put the objects in. To make things worse, all kinds of trouble appear on screen to make it just a little bit more challenging. Like crocodiles that eat object or jokers that throw around playing cards offsetting your carefully balance scale. The game stages 5 different game worlds each divided into 16 levels.</desc>

    <desc>King Dedede is at it again, this time taking all of the stars from the sky. Thankfully for Dreamland, Kirby has returned to stop the evil King once more. But this time, he will need your help more then ever before.

Kirby has been turned into a ball, and it is up to you to tilt and turn the game table so that Kirby can dodge enemies and get the the end goal. To do this, you must actually tilt the Game Boy Color/Advance console, thanks to the inbuilt motion sensor in the cartridge. Every move you make determines where the little pink ball goes.</desc>

    <desc>KLUSTAR takes TETRIS and twists it around. Rather than moving falling pieces, you must move and rotate a group of pieces that is stuck together. The goal is to get the moving pieces to stick together, forming a solid square of blocks. One that is done, the square disappears and the remaining pieces collapse inward, creating more room to maneuver. If you miss a piece, it will stick to the sides of the play area and cannot be removed. The game ends when the cluster of pieces becomes so big that it cannot fit into the screen. With 16 skill levels, the degree of challenge is always appropriate. If friends want to join the action, they can via a link cable. See how long you can last in KLUSTAR.</desc>

Choose from 38 professional boxers from all weight classes including Evander Holyfield, Ike Quartey, Lennox Lewis, Michael Moore, Shane Mosley, Oscar De La Hoya, &quot;Sugar&quot; Ray Leonard, and Muhammad Ali. For some quick action, choose any two boxers and enter an Arcade match. Arcade matches are less realistic and can result in quick knockouts. However, you can also choose to play in a simulation Exhibition match, where you must master ring strategies and wear down your opponent. If you are looking for a real challenge, create a boxer and fight through the ranks and become world champion. KNOCKOUT KINGS brings the subtlety of the sweet science to your handheld, without having pay outrageous pay-per-view prices.</desc>

    <desc>4 more classic Konami titles bundled on the one cart. 

On this occasion, the games are Parodius (an R-type style shooter with plenty of humor and crazy characters); Block Game (much the same as Tetris, although here falling shapes must be shot at by your ship at the bottom of the screen, to form a type of square shape. By doing so, the blocks are removed from the screen); Track and Field (a collection of track and field events including the 100m sprint, hurdles, long jump, triple jump and more); and finally, Frogger, the classic top-down puzzle game where the aim is to move your little frog across the road and the pond, dodging cars and crocodiles along the way to the lilipad.

Again, all games can be played in color on the GBC, or in black and white on the original Game Boy console.</desc>

    <desc>The fourth Konami classics compilation includes two sequels: Gradius II &amp; Castlevania II, and two original titles: Antarctic Adventure &amp; Yie Ar Kung Fu.

Gradius II: Return of the Hero continues the side-scrolling shoot &apos;em up adventure from the previous title (as seen in Konami GB Collection Vol. 1). 5 levels await, each with a collection of bad guys, end of level bosses, and collectable upgrades for power, speed, attack and defense. You can also practice the first four levels.

Castlevania II: Belmont&apos;s Revenge has you returning to battle Dracula, this time as Christopher Belmont. A total of four castles are waiting to be tackled head on in any order you choose. Once they are defeated (each on including an boss), you can then enter Dracula&apos;s castle to take on the big bad vamp himself. Your whip, holy water and the holy cross are the only things protecting you from the undead.

Antarctic Adventure is a 3rd person racing style game, where you must race your pengiun through the ice covered levels, past obstacles and other enemies to the end goal before the time runs out.

Yie Ar Kung Fu is a one-on-one fighting game, where each enemy you face increases in difficulty. Defeat the five opponents, and then get ready to fight them again at an even harder difficulty level. Throwing stars, climbing up walls and hand to hand combat all come into play.</desc>

    <desc>Lego Island 2: Brickster&apos;s Revenge is the sequel to the successful PC game Lego Island. The game begins as an RPG in which you travel around Lego Island, delivering pizza and talking to your fellow citizens. Until you hear about Brickster&apos;s escape from prison, and his attempt to deconstruct all the buildings on Lego Island. 

Varied gameplay, as LEGO Island 2 is part flying game, part racing game, part sky-diving drill, and part astronaut training mission. You&apos;ll interact around 50 or more different characters from Lego Island.

Along the way, you&apos;ll have to fly bi-planes, race LEGO cars, command space shuttles, and skateboard through a plethora of areas based on LEGO&apos; series of play themes, like LEGO Knight&apos;s Kingdom, and the LEGO Adventurers.

Also featured are 18 sub-games, as well as a lego-themed skate park where you and Pepper can try a ton of skateboard tricks anytime.</desc>

    <desc>Lego Stunt Rally is an edu-tainment racing title and construction set based on the popular building blocks. The game is played from an overhead perspective on the race track, which is rendered in real-time 3D. You control the acceleration and side to side movement of the car, but actually maneuvering around corners is taken care of by the computer.

The game has both single and multiplayer modes.  The single player mode includes a championship game in which you can earn new building blocks for the construction mode. The multi-player game allows up to 4 players to compete on the same computer.

The construction mode allows you to construct tracks of your own, and is powerful enough to create a wide variety of races.</desc>

    <desc>Your task is to rescue the Lemmings across 120 levels of fast-paced puzzling. These creatures simply walk blindly through the world in the hope of reaching safety at the end of the level - unfortunately these levels include steep drops, gaps in the ground, barriers and rivers amongst other hazards.

You are in control not of any individual Lemming, but of a cross-hair, which can be moved over any of the Lemmings. Along the bottom are a selection of functions which can be assigned to a Lemming, including climbing, floating and bashing. You must click to select the appropriate function, then click on the Lemming to activate it. Each level has a different range of skills on offer, a different amount of Lemmings, and a different percentage target in order to progress.</desc>

    <desc>To coincide with the release of another Little Mermaid video, Disney has also released another Little Mermaid videogame. LITTLE MERMAID 2 PINBALL FRENY for the Game Boy Color is just what the name implies, a frenzied pinball game. There are two different boards that can be played on, each with several variations of their own. The Ariel board contains paddles that are put at varying places to throw off people too used to traditional pinball machines, and it makes them learn some new strategies. The Melody board has many different ramps and drop spots to create its own unique atmosphere. Each board contains eight mini-games that differ from simple actions to more complex objectives. The game also comes with a built-in Rumble Pak, guaranteed to deliver plenty of shaking to help make the game a more realistic experience. LITTLE MERMAID 2 PINBALL FRENZY delivers a pinball experience geared toward young players, but has enough gameplay and variation to please most any fan of the genre.</desc>

Displeased by their father&apos;s lack of confidence in them, Adrian and Cassius leave Hell and go to Earth to create a new Hell. Since Satan has no time to deal with Adrian and Cassius, he sends his other son Nicky to stop them. You take the role of Nicky as he travels through 24 levels, where he must collect a certain number of items or destroy demons. However, the key to making it through all of the levels is Nicky&apos;s power. When Nicky gets close to fire, his powers increase. He will run faster, jump higher, and spit fireballs. Should he get too hot, Nicky will be unable to control his powers until he cools down. Help Nicky capture Adrian and Cassius in LITTLE NICKY.</desc>

    <desc>LOGICAL adds a distinctive puzzle game experience to the Game Boy Color. Each of the 99 levels starts with a unique arrangement of pipes and slotted gears. Balls of various colors roll through a pipe at the top of the screen, and they&apos;ll fall into the gear and pipe arrangement. The goal is to get balls of the same color to fill all of the slots of a gear. Once that happens, the balls disappear. But time is always a factor in doing this, so you&apos;ve got to be efficient. As the game progresses, several complicating factors enter the mix: some pipes will only allow balls to travel one way, and other will only let balls of one color pass through. The biggest problem is that some levels require colors be removed in a particular order. Try to solve as many puzzles as you can with LOGICAL</desc>

    <desc>Looney Tunes: Carrot Crazy is a side scrolling platform game featuring famous Warner Bros. cartoon characters Bugs Bunny and Lola Bunny. After finding out all carrots have been stolen from their garden, as Bugs or Lola Bunny the player will have to investigate. Bugs will have to explore the Warner Bros. studio to find out who stole the carrots.

Like many platform games you walk from left to right through a level. There are five different worlds which represent the surroundings of characters Yosemite Sam, Marvin the Martian, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd and the Tasmanian Devil. Each world is divided into several levels. The object of each level is to find all film clapboards present.

Bugs and Lola can jump and hit things with a mallet (or rolling pin for Lola). They also both feature unique special abilities. Bugs Bunny can dig and move heavy chests and Lola can float down safely from large heights with her parasol. Players can switch between characters at any time.

Power-ups in the game include carrots for energy required for special abilities, a super carrot that allows the player to fly like a helicopter (using his ears) and the habanero carrot, which makes the player invincible for a while.

If you collect the letters EXTRA during the level you get to play a small minigame where you have to shoot firecrackers at moving targets.

Each of the worlds ends with a showdown with the major character of that world. Usually this involves running from a vehicle that pursues the player, while avoiding obstacles.</desc>

In doing so, K-9 accidentally threw out 10 pieces of the teleporter that are required to execute Marvin&apos;s plan to destroy the Earth. Bugs Bunny happens to overhear the Martian&apos;s plan, and now he must travel throughout the world and collect the other Looney Tunes characters 47 in all. While Bugs can perform basic tasks, solving all of the game&apos;s puzzles and collecting all 10 teleporter pieces requires the special skills and talents of each character. For example, Elmer Fudd can blast obstacles with his gun, while Daffy Duck can swim and dive into deep water. Learning how and when to use each character is the key to success in LOONEY TUNES COLLECTOR: Alert!</desc>

    <desc>You play as Lucky Luke, lonesome cowboy, who draws his gun faster than his shadow.  In a received telegram you read that Jesse James, Billy the Kid, Pat Poker, and The Dalton Brothers have escaped from jail. You as a good cowboy and law keeper have to catch them and return them back, finishing 12 levels of the game.

Players guide Luke through levels by walking, jumping, climbing and ducking.  There are also objects to collect such as dynamite (which can be used to reveal hidden paths), revolver barrels, sheriff stars and other useful items.  You also have to use collected items to get past a certain obstacle, such as to show a red cloth to a bull, feed a dog with a bone, and so on. Luke can attack enemies by shooting in straight or diagonal directions.  Shooting exhausts the six bullets in your gun&apos;s barrel. To kill the bandits, bad Indians, prisoners, you should shoot at them for a certain number of times.

Locations of the levels vary from towns, saloons, and jails, to the prairies, ranches, and Indian village in Cheyenne Mountains. At the end of most levels you have to challenge one of the bosses, and at the end of the final level you should challenge four Daltons one after another again.

Some levels are scrolling arcades such as stagecoach traveling, chasing a train, escaping the Tornado or Buffalo, or flowing in the rapids. Also the bonus level is present, where you should shoot all the bottles to get and extra life.</desc>

    <desc>The first entry in the long-running Madden football series on the Game Boy Color is also the first entry in the series on a handheld in three years. The versions on consoles and computers having migrated to 3D graphics, the GBC edition uses traditional sprite-based 2D with a top-down view of the playing field.

Game modes include Exhibition matches, Sudden Death games (first team to score wins), Full Seasons and Playoffs. Progress can be saved through use of passwords. Game features include many known from other iterations of the series, such as player injuries and substitutions, audibles, detailed statistics, control of weather and game time, and more. The playbook not only includes a wide number of standard plays, but also a variety of trick plays like fake field goals and reverse plays.

Team and player names and statistics are from the 1999 NFL season.</desc>

    <desc>The first mobile entry in the series to be published by Electronic Arts proper instead of THQ, Madden NFL 2001 is the second iteration on the Game Boy Color, from new developer 3d6 Games.

The game modes are Exhibition, Season and Playoffs, and for the first time, the game also offers a two-player mode over the link cable. The 2D top-down graphics have been improved compared to earlier versions, and the game offers quarterback speech for the first time on a mobile platform.

Gameplay features are as usual: a large playbook, audibles, player injuries and substitutions, and detailed statistics. The game features the player stats and team names and logos from the 2000 NFL season.</desc>

    <desc>MAGICAL DROP has a character facing imminent doom as bubbles slowly make their way towards him from the top of the screen. To get rid of the bubbles, you can grab bubbles of one color from the pile and move them to another area. When three or more bubbles of the same color touch, they will explode and destroy all of the like-colored bubbles around them. When bubbles are destroyed, those remaining in the pile float up and cause more to bubbles to burst in a chain reaction. This is a rather simple premise, but it&apos;s not easy to master. While the single-player game is fun, use a link cable and share the fun with a friend. Try to clear as many bubbles as possible with MAGICAL DROP.</desc>

    <desc>A port of the arcade game. The idea is deceptively simple: Guide a marble down a path without hitting any obstacles or straying off the course. The game is viewed from an isometric perspective, which makes it harder to stay focused on the direction the ball is to follow. There are tight corridors to follow and enemies to avoid. There is a 2-player mode in which players must race to the finish; otherwise you&apos;re racing against the clock.</desc>

    <desc>Mario Golf on Game Boy Color isn&apos;t a straight port of the N64 game - it&apos;s a totally different game in its own right. It is a combination of a golf game and an RPG. As in an RPG, you choose your character at the beginning, with various strengths and weaknesses, and throughout the course of the game, your character gains experience points through winning matches or playing mini-games. Experience points can be distributed to various skills, such as putting, which makes it easier for you to do well. There are quite a few skills, and no two characters you can create will play in exactly the same way.

Although the story mode is the main part of the game, there&apos;s quite a few other modes to keep you busy, like Tournament, Match Game, Stroke, Training, and the two-player mode via link cable. It comes with a dictionary of all the golf terms you&apos;ll need, and an extensive range of statistics on your player.</desc>

    <desc>Mario Tennis for the Game Boy Color is a much different experience than its N64 effort. In addition to the core gameplay found in the N64 version, the GBC version features an RPG-style world that allows you to work your way up through the ranks at the Royal Tennis Academy.

The main mode, Mario Tour, has you starting off as a Rookie with low stats. By completing training programs and defeating other students, you&apos;re able to gain experience points, which allow you to boost your tennis stats. When you&apos;re not playing tennis, you can spend time wandering the Academy grounds: talking to other students, or just taking in the sights and sounds.

In addition to the main game, there&apos;s also an exhibition mode (singles or doubles) for quick-play. And, if you get tired of playing the computer, the game supports the Game Link Cable for play against a friend.</desc>

    <desc>Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen star in the portable adventure about junior detectives who can &quot;solve any crime by dinnertime.&quot;

Each mystery they solve is presented as a puzzle.  Each level gives you one piece of the puzzle.  Solve the entire puzzle and you&apos;ve solved the mystery.

Each level has you switching control between three characters: Mary-Kate, Ashley, and their dog, Clue.  Each character has different abilities.  Ashley can flip switches to open doors and the cage in which the puzzle piece is hidden.  She can also pick Clue up and throw him.  Clue can be thrown and he can swim.  Other characters can stand on him to get a bit of a boost to their jumps as well.  Mary-Kate serves as a trampoline of sorts.  The other characters can bounce on her head for a big jump boost.  She can also jump the highest of the three.

In each level, you must use the special abilities of all characters to remove obstacles,open the cage that contains the puzzle piece and reach piece.  There are five mysteries in all, each with eleven stages, for a total of fifty-five levels of puzzle-solving.</desc>

    <desc>Some totally cute boys have invited Mary-Kate and Ashley to a beach party but the directions have met a terrible fate! Someone has torn up the map that the twins were going to use to get to the shindig, and now they must pool their resources and find all of the pieces before the party starts without them. Some of the map is split up between the classrooms at school, some of them are in the hands of some weird girl that won&apos;t give them back, and others have completely disappeared. There are tons of mini-games to keep young gamers busy here, including a mini-golf outing, a cheerleading challenge, and many others. One of the game&apos;s best features is a creative music-making program that allows kids to punch in their own cool beats and tunes. You&apos;ll start out the game in the freshman class, but piecing together the map and completing a few of the side games will earn you a pass to the higher grades. Get good marks and chase after good-looking boys in this fabulous adventure.</desc>

    <desc>Mary Kate and Ashley: Winner&apos;s Circle is an isometric horse racing game.  You pick either one of the Olsens, and a horse, then an event.  Most events are essentially clock or checkpoint race where you must make it through the track or jump all the gates before time runs out, but there are also challenge stages with more varied goals such as collection.

Controls can be done either Mary-Kate style, where you use left and right to turn the horse, or Ashley style, where the horse will point in the direction you press on the D-pad.  In both cases, B kicks the horse to get them moving and A signals them to jump.</desc>

    <desc>Maya the Bee &amp; Her Friends is the first game based on Maya the Bee, a world famous German book, comic, and animated cartoon series. This licensed title is based on the animated cartoon series.

In the game evil spiders have kidnapped insects and asking for honey as ransom. It is up to Maya and her friends to thwart their evil schemes.

The game has the player control three insects one at a time, but together on the same screen, Maya the bee, Willy the bee and Flip the grasshopper. Each insect has its own abilities. Maya can pull levers and Flip allows the others to leap to higher places. In each of the 120 levels an insect has to be saved and the three have to combine their skills to puzzle their way through the spider&apos;s web, in a similar vein as The Lost Vikings.

The game was released in Europe only and is identical to The New Adventures of Mary Kate and Ashley, but with a different license. The same engine was later also re-used in Mary-Kate and Ashley Get a Clue.</desc>

    <desc>Metal Gear Solid (original Japanese name: Metal Gear: Ghost Babel) for GameBoy Color is not the same game as the popular Playstation/PC installment of the series. It is not set within the storyline of Metal Gear series, but instead tells an unrelated episode featuring the same hero - special agent Solid Snake. A secret government project, codenamed &quot;Babel&quot;, attempts to revive the Metal Gear project - development of a highly destructive mech weapon. But an organization known as Gindran Liberation Front hijacked the Metal Gear prototype, without which any further development would be useless. Solid Snake is sent to infiltrate Outer Heaven, a location not entirely unfamiliar to him, and to retrieve the prototype.

The game is similar in style and gameplay to early Metal Gear games. It is viewed from top-down perspective, and its gameplay is mostly based on stealth. Snake has to sneak past the guards, using various tactics to distract them or to kill them silently. Weapons, gadgets, and moves are all similar to those used in the other Metal Gear Solid game. From time to time Snake will also encounter bosses whom he will have to defeat in order to proceed to the next area. Virtual Missions for Snake are also included in this release.</desc>

    <desc>Metal Walker is a mechanical take on Pokémon, where the story takes place in the future on an island where a mysterious element called core has been discovered.  This &quot;core&quot; element was used to create a highly advanced race of robots called Metal Walkers that are used for both labor and protection for the people of the island.  One day, however, a gang of robots decide to rebel and end up killing a very prominent member of the island.  The player then takes control of the son, Tetsuo, with the help of Dr. Hawk and Tetsuo&apos;s Metal Walker in an attempt to hunt down the rebel robots and avenge his father&apos;s death.

The gameplay is very similar to Pokémon, where the player explores various areas of the island searching for clues called Data Packets and battling other Metal Walkers or wild Walkers called Metal Busters, but instead of capturing these walkers, the player instead destroys them.  Destroying these other Walkers results both in scrap metal and items called Capsules that can be used to upgrade or &quot;evolve&quot; Tetsuo&apos;s Walker into a more advanced form.  Additionally, the player can take the scrap metal to the Junk Shop where they can also be turned into capsules as well.  Additionally, capsules can not only contain power-ups, but traps as well that can be used in battles.

The battles are also different, whereas this one the attacks consists of rolling attacks that are angled off of the walls of arenas.  Additionally, if a player fights multiple opponents, all of the enemies will be present on the screen at one time and if they choose the right attack and angle, can result in multiple hits on multiple opponents.

There are also three types of Walkers: Land, Marine, and Sky where, just like in Pokémon, susceptible to the other (ex. Land walkers have advantages over Marine walkers but are vulnerable and weaker to Sky Walker attacks).  Base camps can also be built around various areas of the island and can be used for restoring the health of the players Walker.

As the player progresses farther into the game, they will encounter over 100 different Walkers, each with their own strengths and weaknesses as well as bosses that have to be defeated in order to access more areas of the island.  Players can also use the Link Cable to both battle their Metal Walkers or even exchange their base camps.</desc>

    <desc>Everyone in Mickey&apos;s home town was getting prepared for a big carnival!  Professor Ludwig Von Drake had just finished all the carnival floats and was showing them to Mickey, Minnie, and all their friends.  However, spying from his creepy mansion on the outskirts of town was Big Bad Pete, furious at the group enjoying themselves.  Soon, he&apos;d gathered his cronies and raced into town, swiping all the floats and decorations.  All that was left was a letter challenging them to a race to get their things back.

Mickey&apos;s Racing Adventure is an adventure game that centers around isometric racing challenges in various worlds.  It&apos;s possible to play as Mickey and his friends, as they explore various parts of Mickey&apos;s town, earning money for car upgrades and finding train tokens to travel to different worlds and challenge Pete and his henchmen to various races.  For a fee, Magica de Spell will also conjure up spells for you to use in races and get an edge on your opponents.

The first time you travel to a new world via the train, Casey Jr., you must play a special train mini-game.  Pete has muddled the tracks leading to the worlds, and you must guide Casey Jr. by shifting the track tiles around so that he doesn&apos;t hit any dead-ends.  There are also TNT detonators that you must set off by running into them before you can guide Casey Jr. to the exit.

The game also allows you to play as Pluto - while he can&apos;t race himself, he can sniff around town and dig for secrets.  He&apos;ll also find hidden tunnels which let you play a Digger-like mini-game where you must either collect all the bones underground, or defeat the other dogs in the area by dropping rocks on them.  After completing the objective, Pluto must then head to the exit.

Mickey&apos;s Racing Adventure also supports the Game Boy Color&apos;s Infra-Red feature by allowing you to send e-mail to your friends via the Infrared Communications port.  Once you unlock the Print Shop, you can also use the Game Boy Printer to print out assorted Disney stickers.</desc>

    <desc>The Weasels have kidnapped Mickey Mouse&apos;s dog!  All that was left was a ransom note with a picture of Pluto being hauled away in a van, and some scrawled writing taunting Mickey to try and catch them.  Not knowing what else to do, Mickey called up his friends, who all volunteered to help - even Big Bad Pete plans to race!  You&apos;ll have to speed across the country to catch up with the weasels and rescue Pluto!

Mickey&apos;s Speedway USA is an isometric racing game that uses the same engine as Mickey&apos;s Racing Adventure.  Players can choose from Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy, Goofy or Pete (and some secret characters too) as they race around various famous cities and landmarks from the United States, including Los Angeles, the Grand Canyon, San Francisco, Montana, and Yellowstone, just to name a few.

The Adventure Mode of the game plays out Grand Prix style.  You must complete four races in each world, and at the end of each race, you&apos;re given points based on your placing.  The player with the most points at the end of the four races wins the trophy for that circuit.  There are assorted power-ups that help you as you race, including the Baseball Chucker (a projectile), the Magno Flyer (a homing missile), the Carbo Spritzer (a turbo), and the Paint Splotcher (an oil slick).

There is also a Time Trial mode which lets you race any track that you&apos;ve previously unlocked - while you can use it to practice tracks, the goal is to race fast enough to beat the track&apos;s lap time and earn a gold star in every race.  Another mode is Professor Von Drake&apos;s &apos;Driving School&apos;.  In this mode, you must complete specific tasks given to you, such as parking, reverse parking and slalom driving.  The faster you perform these tasks, the better ranking you will receive (again, with a gold star as your ultimate goal).  However, you will receive a time penalty if you hit a cone or wall, or miss your parking spot, so accuracy counts as well.

Mickey&apos;s Speedway USA supports many of the Game Boy Color&apos;s functions - you can play a two-player link cable race, transfer data from Mickey&apos;s Racing Adventure via the IR Link to unlock a secret, and connect to the Nintendo 64 version of Mickey&apos;s Speedway USA using the Transfer Pak.  As you progress through the game, you&apos;ll unlock many postcards and pictures for your album, which can be printed out via the Game Boy Printer.</desc>

    <desc>Tiny cars race through the house in MICRO MACHINES 1 AND 2: Twin Turbo. Take 15 vehicles including jeeps, helicopters, tanks, speedboats, and sports cars onto 60 different tracks like the breakfast table, the garden, and the pool table. Each track has its own obstacles and hazards, so keep your eyes peeled. For example, watch out for the rubber ducks, soapsuds, and whirlpool drain in the bathtub. The biggest hazard is falling off of the track, which costs time and puts you way behind. As an added bonus, there is a Two-Player mode that can be played on one Game Boy: one player uses direction pad and the other uses the buttons to steer his vehicle left or right, the goal being to push the opposition off of the track. With all of the track and vehicle choices, there is plenty to keep you playing MICRO MACHINES 1 AND 2: Twin Turbo.</desc>

    <desc>Micro Maniacs Racing is a racing game in the Micro Machines series. This time however, you don&apos;t get to race cars, boats or any other type of vehicle, but micro men. Most courses are on foot, but others allow you to take small vehicles such as jet skis and skate boards.

The game offers a variety of micro men to play with, ranging from mutants, cyborgs, mad professors, experiments gone wrong, and other strange characters. They all have their own special weapon to give them an edge in the races. There are 32 races which are organised by a mad doctor who hopes to find the ultimate soldier among these micro maniacs.

The Game Boy Color version is completely in 2D. In good Micro Machines tradition, the races are all held in and around the house, including the garage, living room, bathroom, study and deck.</desc>

    <desc>The programmers at Microsoft are porting a game from their operating system over to the Game Boy Color with MICROSOFT PINBALL ARCADE. This pinball game was great fun on the PC, and now it is in a form that can be taken anywhere. There are seven different tables that are actually representative of real boards made by pinball giant Gottlieb throughout the last century. Each board carries a different theme, whether it is space travel or a haunted house. The boards also contain a varying number of paddles and paddle locations to make each a different playing experience. The graphics in this version are not as shiny as its computer counterpart, but they do translate well to the small color screen. The sound effects and music remain largely the same, adding to the game&apos;s arcade feel. The cartridge also contains a short but detailed history of pinball and how it has evolved over the years. MICROSOFT PINBALL ARCADE gives players the classic game with enough boards and extras to keep even the experts busy for quite a while.</desc>

Your goal is to target the missiles and fire your defensive weaponry; if the cloud from your weapon touches the missile, it is destroyed. However, you only have a limited number of shots, and if all sections of the city are destroyed, it&apos;s Game Over. After successfully defending a city from two waves of missiles, you will be treated to a special animation that is related to the city.

    <desc>Monkey Puncher is a game where the goal is to train a monkey to fight in boxing matches in order to save your kidnapped sibling. You can choose to play as either a boy or a girl character; the one you do not pick is your sibling. 

Shortly after starting the game you are given your first monkey, Freddy. You can train him in skipping, using a punchbag, doing sit-ups, running and even going shopping. There is also a sixth activity, called sparring. These activities work to improve his speed, power, strength, stamina, knowledge and (for the latter activity) all of these, although only by a small amount.

In all of the aforementioned apart from shopping, you train your monkey by getting him to copy your actions; your actions are controlled by the rhythmic pressing of the A button. After a while, your monkey should be able to imitate your actions with ease, eventually being able to start the activity without prompting. In regards to shopping, you can send him out to buy what you want from a selection of items, or just let him go out and buy what he likes. This is a good way of obtaining certain items that are otherwise unobtainable. The rarity of items and the accuracy of which items it brings home from your shopping list increases as its knowledge does. Sparring involves pitting your own monkey against a computer controlled one in order to raise every stat by a small amount. Finally, you can &apos;date&apos; your monkeys, either with each other, with a friend&apos;s monkey or in the dating shop available within the game. This is a good way of obtaining monkeys with higher stats, depending on which monkeys you breed and with whom. 

During boxing matches, you do not have direct control over your monkey, but in between bouts you can do things such as refill its health, stamina, or both. You can also advise it on what strategy to use against its opponent. These matches are won by either a count or by KO&apos;ing the opponent, however if time runs out before there is a clear winner, the winner is the monkey who is left with the most health at the end of the match.</desc>

    <desc>Monster Rancher Explorer is an updated port of Tecmo&apos;s 1987 NES game, Solomon&apos;s Key and features environments, characters and monsters from the Monster Rancher series of games. The game is a platformer with action elements. Each level requires a puzzle to be solved within a time limit, giving the successful player a key to unlock the next level. Bad monsters will attack on most levels, so in addition to moving blocks to get to the key on each level, a player needs to dispatch bad monsters before being killed by them. There are good monsters to meet, several hidden bonus levels, bonus items, and treasure to be found.</desc>

    <desc>Two fighters enter the arena; the winner will move on in the tournament, the other will be dead. This tournament for control of Earth has been going on for centuries and continues in MORTAL KOMBAT 4. Choose from eight different characters: Fujin, Liu Kang, Sub Zero, Tanya, Quan Chi, Raiden, Reiko, Shinnok, Scorpion, and a few hidden characters as well. Each character has unique moves, combinations, and fatalities, and when you properly execute a fatality, a short animated reenactment plays. Throughout the game, there are special Kombat Kodes that are exclusive to the Game Boy Color, and you&apos;ll also get quite a bit of in-game speech. If you think you are the strongest fighter, prove it with MORTAL KOMBAT 4.</desc>

There are power pellets located in each corner of the maze which, when eaten, turn the ghosts blue. Once this happens, the ghosts can be eaten. Occasionally, fruit will float into the maze, which can be munched for extra points. If your friends want to play along, there is an alternating Two-Player mode. As an additional bonus, a complete version of SUPER PAC-MAN is included on the cartridge. Play as the first female arcade hero in MS. PAC-MAN: Special Color Edition.</desc>

    <desc>Based on the 2001 movie starring Brendan Frasier and Rachel Weisz, this version differs greatly from it&apos;s console version.  The main bulk of the game is side-scroller with stages where the player moves from right to left trying to escape a wall of water while avoiding enemies and pitfalls and even a scene recreating the valley escape in the blimp, but with the same elements.  There are also one-on-one sword fighting stages where the player uses a sword to hack away at enemies that appear one at a time and even a first-person shooting stage that resembles Lethal Enforcers.

There are three different characters to choose from, Rick O&apos;Connel, Evelyn O&apos;Connel and Ardeth Bay that they can choose at the beginning of each stage, each with their own strengths and weaknesses and depending on which character they pick will determine which stage layout will be present (ex. Rick &amp; Evelyn&apos;s water escape stage feature different traps and enemies they must avoid).

There are eleven stages total and a password feature that allows players to pick up and play at their leisure.</desc>

    <desc>Based on the Fox cartoon series of the same name, NASCAR RACERS is a glimpse of what NASCAR will be like in the future. You can choose from five different cars, each with its own abilities that increase during the course of the race including one car that becomes invincible and another that gains a huge burst of speed. After you choose the correct car for your driving style, hit one of the 20 tracks available in the game. While you&apos;re on the track, you need to keep an eye out for the oil slicks, water puddles, and random debris that will slow down or damage your car. If the car sustains too much damage, then the race is over, for you anyway. Luckily, there is a truck to refuel and repair your vehicle. Will you be able to cross the finish line in NASCAR RACERS?</desc>

    <desc>This is a 3-on-3 basketball game for the Nintendo Game Boy/Game Boy Color handheld, featuring all the teams and players from the 1999-2000 NBA season. The game is played through an isometric perspective on the arena similar to NBA Live &apos;96 for the SNES. 

The game is jammed with all the goods you expect in a basketball game including real teams, players, and lots of stats. You can play an exhibition, full season, or playoffs with your favorite team, and you will be able to customize the rules of the game right down to the amount of time per game played. Although you only have 6 players on the court at any time, all of the usual plays and move are available, and you can sub at any time. There is also a create-a-player mode for you to put your name in the game, and you can trade for any player you like.

2 player support is also included.</desc>

    <desc>This game is the sequel to NBA Showtime. The gameplay has been improved quite a bit. Now you play 3-on-3 instead of 2-on-2. There are also a few new moves added such as alley-oops. The number of players in the game has increased to 140 and there are now more secret courts. The gameplay is still very similar to last year&apos;s game but the added extras are welcome and makes the game a little more enjoyable to play.</desc>

    <desc>The first PC conversion of the arcade hit, NFL Blitz gives the National Football League the same over-the-top treatment that Midway had used so effectively with NBA Jam.  Features include exaggerated muscle-bound player models, &quot;turbo&quot; buttons, fast action, and some pretty wild rules changes (like 30 yards for a first down!). Blitz is nothing if not a unique football gaming experience.

Player taunts (&quot;This is MY HOUSE!&quot;), unpenalized late hits, and amusing running commentary from the announcers (&quot;That was totally uncalled for -- but awfully fun to watch!&quot;) all add to the game&apos;s violent charm.</desc>

    <desc>NFL BLITZ 2000 brings fast-paced, no-holds-barred football action to the field. Rather than offering a standard football game, NFL BLITZ 2000 changes the rules a little. The game is played seven-on-seven, and it takes 30-yards to get a first down. But probably the most important rule change is that there are no penalties. When you start the game, you have the choice of playing in the Arcade or Season mode. Arcade has you pick a team and try to defeat all of the other teams in the league, while in the Season mode, you take your team through the grueling NFL season in hopes of making the playoffs and winning the Super Bowl. No matter how you play the game, you will not miss a second of the action, thanks to three different camera angles. Try to keep your helmet on while playing NFL BLITZ 2000.</desc>

Take all the tiresome rules and regulations of standard football and throw them out the window BLITZ is fast, furious, and out of control. Real-life NFL stars are modeled here in a brutish, cartoon-inspired fashion and their burly physiques are perfect for inflicting damage on your opponents. Listen and laugh at humorous commentary from the in-game announcer and garner helpful hints from the sexy cheerleaders as you attack your way upfield towards the goal line. And you can savor all the bone-crushing pigskin mayhem again and again in a helmet-cracking replay mode. You&apos;ll watch in awe as your team catches fire after a series of excellent plays. Compete in four stadiums new to the franchise like the &quot;Stadium of the Future,&quot; watch the action from a range of angles (including Blimp view), go head-to-head in Single-Player competition, and much more. Taunting, tackles, and touchdowns are all part of the &quot;First -and-Goal Frenzy&quot; of NFL BLITZ 2001.</desc>

    <desc>Nicktoons Racing for the Game Boy Color is conceptually similar to its console counterpart. It&apos;s a kart racing game but on the handheld it is viewed from a top down perspective. Some of the most famous Nickelodeon characters are competing on the race track and the player can choose to play as any of them. 

Two game modes exist: quick race and championship. In the quick race mode players can choose to play any track of the four available program environments. In the championship the player has to complete each track in a specific order. 

The game allows the player to race as the following seven Nickelodeon characters:

1. Tommy
2. Eliza
3. CatDog
4. Arnold
5. SpongeBob SquarePants
6. Dagget
7. Norbert

Tracks are divided into four different program environments: Angry Beavers, The Wild Thornberrys, SpongeBob SquarePants and Rugrats. There&apos;s numerous power ups that the player can pick up. For example: Checkered Flag will increase the car&apos;s top speed, wrapped package gives the player a free lap, stop sign will stop the opponents for a short time and the milk bottle causes the opponents to lose traction.</desc>

    <desc>With such notable worldwide popularity, it was only a matter of time before the boys of NSYNC got their own handheld video game. Join JC, Justin, Chris, Joey, and Lance in the most daring adventure the group has ever embarked upon, helping them get to the show before curtain time. Of course, life is never easy for these highly sought-after recording artists, so you&apos;ll have to help them with such challenges as making snacks and running errands in a stretch limousine. If you can accomplish these feats, you might even get to help the band warm up for their big show with a friendly game of hackey-sack! Packed with challenges and dangerous distractions, the game&apos;s real appeal is its goofball spirit and dedication to the band itself. Each of the group&apos;s members&apos; distinct personality shines through, making this an awesome title for anyone who likes NSYNC.

    <desc>In 2000 Ubi Soft released two David O&apos;Leary-licensed games. One, David O&apos;Leary&apos;s Total Soccer 2000,  based on the PC game with the same name. The other one was a manager game, O&apos;Leary Manager 2000.

The gameplay in O&apos;Leary Manager 2000 is not only about the management aspects of football. It&apos;s a bit similar to Sensible World of Soccer, as you can play not only as the manager but also the player. This rendered using an top-down view similar to many Amiga games from the early nineties.

In total there is 240 licensed teams from the top two divisions in six European countries. As the manager you get to lay up training schedules, buy and sell players, pick the right players for the right tactics, and a lot of statistics. The game handles matches in three different ways, playing them, watching them or a text-based interface similar to Championship Manager, but with highlights shown in the top-down view. If you don&apos;t want to play through the whole season, you can play single matches against the AI or another player. The manager mode also supports multiple players.</desc>

    <desc>Abe thought he had saved the Mudokons from the evil Glukkons with the destruction of Rupture Farms. However, a new threat has arisen: the Glukkons who run Soul Storm Brewery have created an addictive drink made from Mudokon bones. To get all of the bones they need, Soul Storm has an army of Mudokon slaves excavating the Mudokon City of Death; when one of the slaves is worked to death, he becomes part of the product. The only person who can put a stop to this is Abe. You will guide Abe as he travels through the brewery and tries to destroy the boilers. Along the way, he must also try to save his people. Luckily, Abe can talk to his people and get them to help defeat the enemies and solve puzzles he faces along the way. Help Abe save the Mudokons in Oddworld Adventures 2.</desc>

    <desc>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980&apos;s, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.

Pac-Man&apos;s goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde). One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points. This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost&apos;s eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</desc>

    <desc>Joanna Dark is about to become a full-fledged agent of the Carrington Institute.  Before she does, though, she has one final field test to complete - an actual mission in the depths of the South American jungle.  Joanna must infiltrate a hidden cyborg manufacturing facility.  Along the way, she will have her first encounter with the nefarious dataDyne corporation.

Perfect Dark is a prequel to the Nintendo 64 game of the same name.  Players assume the role of Joanna Dark, just before her induction into the Carrington Institute.  The game plays from a top-down perspective, and you battle enemies with a variety of high-tech weaponry, from handguns to rocket launchers. A weapon can be assigned to the A Button and the B Button, which represent your left hand and your right hand.  It&apos;s also possible to search dead enemies for items and ammo by pressing Select near their corpse.

Perfect Dark also includes a variety of mini-games which you encounter as you progress through the story.  There are target ranges to practice in, vehicles to drive, sniper rifle sections, which are viewed through the sniper scope, and more.  There are also boss battles against enemy cyborgs, helicopters, and other deadly enemies.</desc>

    <desc>Released in conjunction with the 2001 cinematic remake, PLANET OF THE APES, the game actually takes its plot from the 1968 original film. Play as Ulysses (the character that Charlton Heston originated), a human who has fallen to a post-apocalyptic Earth ruled by primates. Ulysses quickly discovers that he is being considered a sort of messiah by many of the apes (he&apos;s considered an enemy by others), and it is becoming readily apparent that the creatures want him to save them from the dangers of this new world. The game is packed with puzzles to solve, and the graphics are among the best ever created for the Game Boy Color. Modes of play include: Normal, in which Ulysses walks from location to location; Athletic, in which the hero runs and jumps through each level of the story; and Stealth, which requires Ulysses to crawl and slink into hidden areas not accessible in other modes. It&apos;s not easy to compare PLANET OF THE APES to any other video game, and that&apos;s really its charm.</desc>

    <desc>Player Manager 2001 is the Game Boy Color version of the long running football management series that started on the Amiga in 1989. It follows the norm of the genre and lets you take control of any team in the top two divisions of five European countries (England, France, Germany, Spain and Italy). As the manager it is your task to buy and sell players, lay up training schedules, set contracts and scout for new players. Most importantly, your job is to choose the right squad, and create tactics that takes advantage of your opponents&apos; weaknesses. There are different staff modes meaning that you can choose to put some parts of the game as auto. The matches are text based.</desc>

    <desc>Long, long ago, the sun was covered by a dark and heavy cloud. It was said this cloud was caused by a monster that had sealed the Sword of the Sun. Legends also says that to break the seal, a hero must collect five Power Stones that are guarded by monsters. Bomberman takes up the challenge as he is the last hero strong enough to defeat such monsters.

This is a side-scrolling platform game. In each world, you must clear four areas by killing any monsters within. To kill a monster, you drop a bomb. After a few seconds, the bomb explodes in a four-way blast. If the monster is within range of the blast, it is killed. After you clear these four areas, you must clear a fifth area by killing a boss to clear the world and collect its Power Stone.

Be careful, though, because if Bomberman is touched by a monster, touches a dangerous item or is caught in the blast of his own bomb, you lose a life. After all lives are gone, you get the option to restart that last area or quit. In most areas, you can, though the placement of bombs, find items to increase your jumping, speed, blast radius, etc.</desc>

    <desc>Pocket Monster mania continues with Nintendo&apos;s release of Pokémon Crystal for the Game Boy Color. Much as 1999&apos;s Pokémon Yellow offered gentle enhancements to the basic story and gameplay of the original Pokémon Red and Pokémon Blue games, Pokémon Crystal is based on the second-wave Pokémon Gold and Pokémon Silver releases.

Though it follows the same story told in the Gold and Silver versions, Pokémon Crystal has some new options and special features. For the first time, gamers have the choice to play as a female trainer in this version. Also, just as Pokémon Yellow included a special Pikachu, trainers are aided by an unusual Suicune in this release. Pokémon Crystal is designed to offer a complete Pokémon experience for those new to the ubiquitous phenomenon and additional challenges for seasoned trainers who simply have to catch &apos;em all.</desc>

Now you can play Jungle Pong, Football Pong, Ice Hockey Pong and 4 player Pong. All this plus 3D graphics. Not to mention animated Penguins (!?!?!).</desc>

    <desc>A.A. Milne&apos;s beloved characters come to interactive life in this wonderful expedition through the Hundred Acre Wood. In order to ensure their party will be, Pooh and Tigger are going to need some honey (known in Milne&apos;s world as &quot;hunny&quot;). In fact, the duo will need to find dozens of pots full of the stuff, and that will mean searching the entire forest. Much to Pooh and Tigger&apos;s collective dismay, the area is populated by dozens of insects, angry animals, and environmental dangers. In addition to searching for the hunny, you&apos;ll have to help your pals find such popular characters as Rabbit, Piglet, and Owl, as well as unlocking dozens of hidden areas and special power-ups. Three mini-games Veggy Match, River Run, and Fence Off can also be uncovered, and you can save all of your progress and resume play with a password. The game spans 18 levels and five diverse environments including The Spring Glade, The Nighttime Forest, Autumn Heights, Creepy Caves, and Winter Wood.</desc>

    <desc>As time is being torn apart by evil forces, there is only one force powerful enough to stop it: the Power Rangers! In POWER RANGERS TIME FORCE for the Game Boy Color, you take the role of the color-coordinated heroes and fight the good fight. The game plays out in 2D battles and side-scrolling action in two different ways: you will be forced to battle enemies in human form, and you&apos;ll also have to band together and become a Megazord to take down the most powerful bosses. Each character offers several different attributes and statistics, so choosing the right Ranger is critical. There are 15 levels in all, each coming with a different theme. You&apos;ll take the Power Rangers everywhere from pyramids to space environments as you fight to save the world. POWER RANGERS TIME FORCE is a great adventure across time and space, and it&apos;s sure to please fans of both side-scrolling games and the numerous incarnations of the television show.</desc>

    <desc>One of three POWERPUFF GIRLS games released together on the Game Boy Color, THE POWER PUFF GIRLS: Battle Him cats you in the role of the lovable Bubbles. Bubbles&apos; nurturing personality shines in the video game, as you help her collect power-ups and battle the infamous, evil &quot;Him.&quot; She might be an elementary school student, but she&apos;ll prove just how dedicated she is to crime fighting, as you help Bubbles shoot her way through level after level of original action. Many of the items that you collect throughout the adventure can be traded for others via friends playing the other POWERPUFF GIRLS games on their systems. Although it&apos;s a one-player game, the trading aspect gives the experience a significantly interactive element. Of course, the brilliant sense of humor from the cartoon series is present throughout the adventure, as are all of the other characters you&apos;ve come to love. Handheld video games just don&apos;t get much more creative (or fun) than this.</desc>

    <desc>The Grand Vizier Jaffar has thrown you into a dark dungeon and plans to marry the girl of your dreams in an hour. You&apos;re not going to let that happen are you? Try to escape from the dungeon, take out Jaffar&apos;s guards, find your way through the Sultan&apos;s palace and defeat Jaffar himself. Now go, you&apos;ve got 60 minutes!

Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer with run and jump gameplay. Your hero must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple puzzles and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. An especially noteworthy aspect of the game is the very fluent animation of your character.

The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies. The Genesis version has a new intro and an altered set of graphics but the level layout remains almost identical to that of the original.</desc>

You&apos;d better be in top form as you command a killer spacecraft out into orbit in hopes of rescuing humanity from unthinkable misery. Each of the eight stages in PROJECT S-11 poses unique challenges, and each setting is more harrowing than the last. Although you&apos;re going it alone in this one, there are four different types of power-ups hidden throughout the game to give the boost you&apos;ll need to survive and wipe out the terrifying extra-terrestrials. You&apos;ll benefit from a complete statistical readout that adorns the right side of your screen, keeping you abreast of all necessary information: your score, your ship&apos;s armor level, and the number of bombs you have stored up for combat. The game&apos;s fast-paced action looks excellent in full color, and the intensity of it will have you breaking a sweat before you&apos;re through the first level.

    <desc>A mix between classic &quot;Walls&quot; and &quot;Bubbles&quot; puzzles games
12 characters to challenge
12 gems to win
Intense competitions
4 amazing game modes

The general objective of Puchi Carat is to destroy gem-like blocks using a ball and paddle. Gems &quot;fall in&quot; from the top of the play area one line at a time and are connected to each other either horizontally or vertically. Hitting a gem with the ball will destroy it, and if the destroyed gem causes other gems to no longer be connected to the top of the play area, they fall off, scoring bonus points. Destroying a special flashing gem also destroys all regular gems of the same color in the playfield. There are also metallic blocks that take more than one hit to destroy.

The player controls a paddle at the bottom of the playfield, which can move left and right to bounce the ball back upward. Unlike in most other Breakout-style games, missing the ball does not cost a life or end the game, but rather adds more lines of gems to the top of the playfield. Gem lines will advance on their own after a certain amount of time, as well as when the playfield is cleared entirely or drops below a certain number of gems. If the gems advance across the line at the bottom of the playfield where the paddle resides, the player loses and the game is over.

The arcade version of Puchi Carat features three main gameplay modes: A single-player mode where the goal is to clear a certain number of gem lines, a story mode in which the player challenges each character in a head-to-head battle (where dropped gems are added to the opponent&apos;s playfield from the bottom), and a two-player versus mode following the same rules as the story mode. Each of the single-player modes offers three levels of difficulty. Various ports of the game offer additional gameplay modes (such as time-attack mode), more difficulty levels, and expanded storylines for each character.</desc>

    <desc>Do you love puzzles? Well, you&apos;re about to put your commitment to the test, as you try your hand at more than 150 different brain-bending challenges. It seems that a maniacal scientist has transported you to a distant dimension. The only way to return to your rightful place is to solve dozens and dozens of puzzles--each of which will get you one step closer to escaping imprisonment and saving the world. Each unique mindbender uses tiles with varied symbols, charging you with the task of eliminating them, rearranging them, or otherwise manipulating them. The color graphics and cool sound effects only add to the charm of this great blend of puzzles and plot. Because PUZZLED has so many different challenges, the game takes hours to tackle, and the replay value is high. If you think you&apos;ve got what it takes to crack a mountain of crazy puzzles and save the world, then you&apos;re just the hero the planet has been waiting for.</desc>

    <desc>The arcade hit Q*BERT comes to the Game Boy Color. The player takes control of an orange creature that hops around a course built of blocks. The goal is to change all of the blocks to the appropriate color by hopping on them. As the game progresses, blocks will require multiple jumps. Complicating the process, a snake that wants to destroy you hops around the course, and there are two balls that go down parts of the course undoing all of your work. There are more than 40 levels to complete with several that are larger than one screen. Since all of the action in the game moves in diagonals, there are two different control schemes to maximize your fun. If you remember playing Q*BERT at the arcade, you will enjoy being able to play it in the palm of your hand.</desc>

    <desc>Can you trap the elusive line of energy that&apos;s bouncing all around? Based on the coin-operated classic, QIX, this GBC sequel to the puzzle-based original offers similar gaming styles and a few welcome updates. In this take, you&apos;ll use a cursor to draw boxes on the screen, avoiding the Qix. If you can draw a compete box without the Qix touching its perimeter, that area of the screen will disappear and get you one step closer to advancing. Adding an element of story, QIX ADVENTURE casts you in the role of Speedy, a treasure hunter who&apos;s traveled to a mysterious island. Each level that you pass will help you in your quest to rid the island of all its strange creatures. Easy to learn but extremely difficult to master, QIX ADVENTURE is addicting fun for puzzle lovers and other gamers. Are you quick enough for Qix? Find out alone or against a friend.</desc>

    <desc>While technology may improve graphics and sound, some things never change. Rampage 2: Universal Tour is very much in tune with its history, barely deviating from the original city-stomping arcade game appearing in the 1980s. Like its predecessor, Rampage World Tour, Rampage 2 retains the original 2D worlds, but improves the graphics, completely re-rendering the characters. The premise remains the same: stomp out cities and wreck things in general. Some new features in Rampage 2 include four new characters (in addition to the original three), new attacks and combos, a power meter, and bonus rounds. The cart allows up to three people can play at once and there are plenty of new cities to destroy.</desc>

    <desc>Rampage World Tour is a updated version of the classic Rampage.  Rampage World Tour starts off at Scumlabs International where three lab technicians, George, Lizzy, and Ralph have mutated in an accident involving toxic waste.  George has turned into a gigantic ape, Lizzy a gigantic lizard or dinosaur, and Ralph some sort of gigantic wolf.  The three destroy the lab they previously worked at and then embark on a path of destruction encompassing the entire globe.

The player chooses one of these three characters and begins destroying buildings, eating civilians, knocking planes out of the sky, and stepping on tanks.  The ultimate goal of the game is to rid the world of Scumlabs by traveling to the cities where they are located.  Being creatures of such massive size, there are many cities that must be destroyed along the way.  Scumlabs and the various militaries make it a priority to destroy you and optionally another player that can play simultaneously.

The graphics are worth noting as they are of a unique, colorful &quot;cartoon&quot; flavor.  Gameplay includes players climb buildings while punching, kicking, and eating their inhabitants to destroy them.  Once all the buildings for a particular stage have been destroyed, the stage is clear and players proceed to the next stage.  Players can get many different kinds of power-ups that make them more powerful or restore health.</desc>

    <desc>Tetris meets shoot-&apos;em-up, Rampart was originally a one or two-player arcade game combining strategy and artillery action. Build your castle from Tetris-style pieces, place your cannons, bombard the enemy, try to repair, do it all over again. Later arcade revisions incorporated 3-player,  and the PC conversion does as well, making it a faithful, entertaining classic for multiple players on the same PC.</desc>

    <desc>Mr. Raz used to be an awful hitman. Luckily he found his girlfriend Loretta Mozzarella and stopped the killing. Turning a new leaf in his life, him and Loretta moved out to the countryside and started a farm instead. However, when mob don Marlon Mozzarella found out that his daughter went missing, he became enraged and ordered his goons to go pick her up. So, if Mr. Raz wants to see his girlfriend ever again, he has no choice but to pick up his weapon again and head to the city.

The game is a side-scrolling platform game, in which you have to make your way through 5 worlds, each spanning 15 levels. You have to collect a certain number of pieces of food before a timer hits zero in order to work your way through the stages, while getting rid of enemies and avoiding obstacles in your way.</desc>

    <desc>When a villain known only as Mr. Dark appears, trouble brews in Rayman&apos;s world.  Mr. Dark captures the Toons - source of light and Rayman&apos;s friends.  With no more light, evil creatures begin to roam, making the world unsafe for everyone.  Its up to you, as Rayman, to free your friends and put an end to Mr. Dark&apos;s dastardly schemes!

Rayman is side-scrolling platformer starring the titular Rayman, a big-nosed chap with no arms or legs.  Rayman can jump and use his hair to hover for a short period of time.  He can also attack by throwing his fists, or winding up his fists for a more powerful punch.  He can occasionally find special power ups that grant him unlimited flying power, giving him the ability to navigate through tricky mazes.

The Game Boy Color version of Rayman remains true to the spirit of the original game, but makes some notable changes, particularly when compared to the original&apos;s bright, vibrant graphics.  Some levels have also been modified or simplified from the original release.</desc>

    <desc>If you have a little one who is ready to start playing videogames, then you should give RESCUE HEROES: Fire Frenzy a try. There are five mini-games to play; some are versions of classic kid&apos;s games, but with a fire theme. One is simple game MEMORY where players must match pictures of animals to rescue them from a fire, while another is similar to SIMON where players must memorize and repeat color combinations. Some of the other games are more action oriented and will challenge anyone&apos;s skill. For example, one game calls for the player to ride a jet ski to rescue people stuck on the other side of a river and drop buckets of water from a helicopter. If you have a Game Boy printer, the medals and awards earned can be printed. Now you can help a young gamer get started with RESCUE HEROES: Fire Frenzy.</desc>

One S.T.A.R.S. member, Leon S Kennedy (from Resident Evil 2) was sent out to destroy the weapon, but the team have been unable to contact him since he arrived at the ship.

Using a combination of top down side-scrolling action and 1st person shooter, it is your job to get aboard the liner, currently floating in the Atlantic Ocean, destroy the weapon and find Leon. Along the way, you&apos;ll come across plenty of deadly  undead enemies, similar to those found in the original Resident Evil series, while using a range of weapons and items found in the ship.</desc>

Aside from enemies which need to be killed there&apos;s also environmental hazards such as fire which have to be avoided.</desc>

    <desc>Road Rash is an aggressive motorcycle racing game where the player assumes the role of a biker who takes part in a series of illegal races across the U.S.A. Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.

By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you&apos;re knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it is possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race.

Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has arcade-like gameplay with no intention to be a motorcycle simulation. While the game has a two-player mode, this is not simultaneous.</desc>

    <desc>OCP Technologies has developed an organic and mechanical hybrid supercomputer which they&apos;ve named &quot;The Mind&quot;. Unknown to the scientists however, The Mind has secretly been infiltrating computer networks around the world. When the project is finally deemed complete, OCP puts The Mind in control of the security systems of Delta City. At the same time, a gang war erupts in the city and several laboratories are broken into and looted. The police recieve a lead on a gang leader named &quot;Nexx&quot; who may be involved and assign RoboCop, a cyborg law enforcement officer, to bring him in.

RoboCop is primarily a top-down action game. Robocop can move up, down, left and right across the map. Enemy units should be shot at to engage, while civilian units need to be protected. RoboCop&apos;s objective varies by level but typically involves destroying a particular enemy or finding &quot;evidence&quot; items scattered throughout the level. Each level is made up of several maps screens. Between missions RoboCop returns to the police station where he can consult with his ex-partner Lewis, review the station&apos;s news or talk to Dr. Lazerus, the scientist in charge of cybernetics.</desc>

    <desc>Robot Wars: Metal Mayhem is the first video game based on the British game show Robot Wars. It was released exclusively for Game Boy Color on 7 December 2000.[1] It was the first of four games based on the show, with the first three selling over 250,000 copies.[2] The game was based on the third series of the show, and competitors such as its champion Chaos 2 feature in the game.

In the game, a competitor robot from the series, or a robot created by the player, is entered into combat against a robot controlled by the game. A bout finishes when one robot&apos;s health bar is fully depleted. In the Tournament Mode, the first robot to win two bouts advances. The game features the arena obstacles and House Robots of the series, and in other modes, a selection of mini-games based on the show&apos;s side events.</desc>

A comprehensive password system will help you pick up progress right where you left off, and the animation is lifted straight from the frames of the television program. If you perform well enough, you might even make the front page of Reggie&apos;s Zine, a publication dedicated to the thrills of alternative sports. Packed with action, cutscenes, and tons of funny stuff, this is one thrill ride you&apos;ll never want to get off of.</desc>

    <desc>Roland Garros French Open is the only appearance of the franchise on the Game Boy Color. Less of a serious simulation of tennis than other versions, the handheld edition features cartoony 2D graphics and outrageous court locations.

All-in-all, the game includes eight different players and twelve different tournaments. Only five players and four tournaments can be selected from the start, the others are unlocked by winning events. The starting tournaments are realistic grand slam events: the Roland Garros French Open (the only one with a license), the English Open (i.e. Wimbledon), the US Championship and the Australian Cup, on clay, grass or turf. Winning them unlocks the more unusual locations: from street and beach tournaments to far-out events in the Antarctic or on the moon.

All events are single elimination, starting at the quarter finals. Matches follow original rules, and are seen from a standard perspective behind the controlled player. All characters (players, officials and fans) are drawn in a cartoony style with oversized heads. The controls allow for a variety of moves including backhand and forehand shots, volleys and lobs.</desc>

    <desc>Rugrats in Paris: The Movie is based on the 2000 Movie of the same name, which in turn is based on the Daytime Emmy-award winning animated television series.

The Game Boy Color iteration of this game looks nothing like its Windows, PlayStation and Nintendo 64 counterparts who share the same name. Like these games, you find yourself in EuroReptarLand, but this time it is all in 2D.

You can move around the theme park using a top-down view. Around the park you will find various points of interest where you can play one of the eight side-scrolling platform levels or seven mini-games.

Advancing to the new platform levels requires you to collect tickets which are won through playing the mini-games. Mini-games include target shooting, fishing, shooting hoop, tossing frogs and hammer shot. The events are displayed on a single screen.

The platform levels have various themes such as clouds, rocket ship, a gooey world, a haunted mine, a volcano, a pyramid, a pagoda and the Notre Dame. The goal of the game is to eventually find Chuckie a princess to become his new mother.</desc>

In order to turn the kids back, she must hit them and then use her magic on them. There are a number of power-ups available to help Sabrina on her quest, including quadruple jumps, a butt stomp, and warping abilities. She can also collect five stars that will allow her to change the kids back without having to stun them first. However, there are areas in each stage that Sabrina cannot reach. So she must find Salem, who can crawl through small spaces and use his tail to knock over blocks to clear a path for Sabrina. Getting through a level will require planning and skill, so put on your thinking cap. Help Sabrina return her classmates to normal in SABRINA THE ANIMATED SERIES: Zapped!</desc>

Modes include time trials, stunt mode including unique track designs to get the most out of your stunts, and a four player &apos;Battlematch&apos; mode that adds weapons to the action.</desc>

    <desc>Scooby-Doo! Classic Creep Capers is a point-and-click adventure game in six chapters. Scooby, Shaggy, Fred, Velma and Daphne are on the trail of a jewel thief. Their investigation leads them to an old spooky house, Jekyll Mansion. Once inside, they search the rooms to gather clues to reveal the identity of the jewel thief. Gameplay consists of positioning characters close to objects in such a way that a menu at the bottom of the screen lights up. The player can then choose the correct action (examine, search, use, take) from the menu. There is also plenty of dialogue involved. To solve puzzles, the player switches between characters and uses each person&apos;s special abilities.

    <desc>What do you say? Itâs Scrabble, right? True, but not as we know it. Ubi Soft has finally reproduced one of the worldâs most popular board games for the handheld gaming community. Yes, this is Scrabble for Game Boy Color. 

Visually, thereâs really not much to say about this Game Boy Color version. The game consists of a series of white tiles each with their own letter and value. Is that enough for you? Oh yes. You know Scrabble. Seven random letters, make a word out of &apos;em, score points. Fall out with opponent optional. 

Seven lettered tiles it is then, with which you must formulate the highest scoring word possible. Clearly, letters such as Q, X and Z have a greater value, but the number of legitimate words that use these letters is limited. Once youâve chosen your word, you must place it on a board in a horizontal or vertical fashion. Certain spaces on the board contain score boosters that will increase the value of your chosen word. Triple Word Score is particularly useful. Your letter supply will then be replenished and you must repeat the process once your opponent has placed his word on the board. At the end of the game, when the supply of tiles is exhausted, the highest scoring player wins. 

So there you have it. Itâs Scrabble on a handheld, and itâs brilliant.</desc>

    <desc>Good sportsmanship is the name of the game in this delightful series of sporting events. All of your favorite SESAME STREET characters are the competitors in these original contests, and winning (for once) is not the most important thing. Take the adorable athletes through six big time sporting events: Guide Grover through a unicycle race, lead Elmo into a roller skating contest, and push Ernie past the rapids in his own bathtub. Big Bird is along to conduct all of the post-game interviews, putting the emphasis of the events squarely on fun and fair play rather than heated competition. The game&apos;s controls are easy top learn allowing little gamers to get the hang of things quickly and an in-game tutorial teaches the ins and outs of each wacky sport. The excellent graphics and familiar faces make the game look and feel just like an episode of the classic kids&apos; show. Hand-held sports have never been so fun!</desc>

    <desc>This is a portable edition of the solitaire game Shanghai, the game uses traditional Mah Jong tiles. The aim of the game is to match tiles, four of each type will be put on the playing field, when two tiles are matched they are removed when none remain you win. Only tiles that can be moved freely to the left or right may be matched. A wrong move may result in you not being able to clear the field. 

A slight story mode is presented in the Shanghai mode; each tile setup is based on a Zodiac animal that needs it power restored. The goal is to complete all twelve of these stages there by restoring the animals power. 

Some variants are also included:

1. Kong Kong: Compete against a computer to clear tiles. If you go slowly you will have tiles sent over to your by your opponent. This type of play is similar to games like Puyo Pop. Kong Kong may be played against another player by using a link cable or against a computer.

2. Challenge (WonderSwan only): A large Shanghai game that you&apos;ll try to race through to get the best score. 

3. Goldrush: In this mode you will race against an opponent to reach a tile marked &apos;G&apos;. G is for GOLD, boy! So get cracking.</desc>

All characters have their own signature moves, but as you move on through the quest more special powers are unlocked  - these include speed, invincibility, and strength. 

Shrek: Fairy Tale Freakdown appears to be aimed to towards young children, due to the character theme and the lack of blood. It is purely a single player game.</desc>

    <desc>Snoopy Tennis lets the player take control of Charles Schultz&apos;s famous Peanuts Gang and compete in a series of tennis games similar to Mario Tennis.  The player can initially choose from eight characters to play (Snoopy, Charlie Brown, Lucy, Linus, Franklin, Sally, Peppermint Patty &amp; Schroeder) each with their unique strengths and weaknesses.  By winning against certain opponents and various modes the player can unlock an additional four characters (Pigpen, Marcie, Rerun and Woodstock).

There are four different courts to choose from, a forest location, the beach, the schoolyard and Charlie Brown&apos;s backyard, with an additional four locations unlocked during gameplay.  There are six different single player game modes to choose from:

1. Normal, which is a best two-out-of-three game set.
2. Power, where the player plays a game of tennis with the ability to use power-ups during the match.
3. Points Win, which the player with the most points within a two minutes wins the match.
4. Sudden Win, which has no service breaks and the first player with two victories wins the game.
5. Squash, which is still a normal game of tennis, but adds walls to both sides of the court.

There is also the Championship mode where the player takes on several different characters on different courts in order to win the Peanuts&apos; Tennis Championship and unlock other characters under different difficulty settings (easy, medium and hard).  There is also a two-player mode using a Game Link and supports three languages to choose from (English, French and Spanish).</desc>

    <desc>In 1978, Earth successfully repulsed an invasion from outer space thanks to &quot;the Tank.&quot;  The Tank was based on alien technology found when a scout ship had crashed years earlier.  Now, over 20 years later, a new Tank has been created based on the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion.  And none too soon, because the Invaders are back!

Space Invaders is yet another classic arcade game remake by Activision.  (See Battlezone and Asteroids.)  But this time, Activision licensed a game from Taito instead of Atari.  The game stays close to its roots while adding many power-ups and enemies.

You can play either one or two players against the Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly rows and columns, at one of three skill levels.  You&apos;ll start at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and finally Earth.  There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow), plus seven more less common ones.  You receive special one shot power-ups by shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row.  As in the original game, there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if you hit them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double shots.  Plus, after fighting off several waves on each planet, you&apos;ll face a unique boss.  If you manage to finish the game, you&apos;ll be able to play a reproduction of the original coin-op.</desc>

Space Marauder is an scrolling shooter game with two modes of play. Most levels are side- and vertical-scrolling with pre-designed layouts. A few levels are different, though: top-down perspective, with a randomized layout. Either way, the player is armed with a variety of weapons, including different guns (laser, missile, ring) and the powerful cobalt bomb which kills everything on screen.

Space Marauder is the Game Boy Color version of Burai Fighter. Game play is exactly the same. Like Burai Fighter it offers the same three difficulties (Eagle, Albatross and Ace), but the game features different level layouts. It doesn&apos;t include the Vs. mode.</desc>

    <desc>Space Station Silicon Valley is a based on the Nintendo 64 game of the same name. It keeps story, gameplay mechanics and even the basic level design while translating everything into a platforming perspective shown from the side. 

The story is about a space station which is populated by independent robot animals. A while ago the station vanished but now it is back on full collision course towards Earth. Of course humanity sends squads out there to end the threat, but everyone but the robot Evo gets lost. The player takes the role of Evo who has to solve 35 levels in order to save Earth.

The unique characteristic of the game is that Evo has the ability to take control over any robot animal he meets. In fact, he is required to do so because his life energy rapidly decreases when outside of a host. All those animals have different abilities which are used to solve the numerous puzzles found in the levels. There are varying goals to complete in each level which range from destroying a machine to guiding sheep to their pens.</desc>

    <desc>Based on the popular Todd McFarlane comic book, Spawn sends the titular hero through four stages of combat.  He must navigate various environmental obstacle while defeating enemies with his fists and guns.

Spawn is a platformer with some shooter elements.  It contains both horizontal and vertical sections.  You must make your way through these and defeat the various thugs and occasional bosses.  Mostly, you&apos;ll be punching and kicking, but there are some guns with rather limited ammunition to find along the way.  There is also one stage where Spawn rids a motorcycle, somewhat along the lines of the surfing and skating levels in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

There are three difficulty modes.  In each mode, enemies can take more damage.  One punch will knock out any minor enemy in easy and you can start at any stage.  It takes two in normal and you must play through from stage one.  On hard, it takes several, so the fighting becomes much more strategic.  You must beat the game on hard mode to get the real ending.</desc>

    <desc>Trouble&apos;s ahead for Peter Parker in Spider-Man&apos;s first appearance on the Game Boy Color: an explosion at Dr. Curt Conners&apos; lab will lead him into a plot planned by a mysterious villain, involving the alien symbiote and several of Spidey&apos;s arch enemies.

The game is a platformer, divided into several large levels. Progression is not strictly linear: some of the levels can be freely explored in any order before continuing with the story. Locations include the city, subway and sewers, the docks and a warehouse. The levels are usually crawling with enemies that Spider-Man can beat up with kicks and punches. Defeating them will eventually result in him gaining levels, becoming stronger and learning some new fighting moves.

Spidey&apos;s special abilities come into play when he swings freely over the rooftops, clings to walls or throws web balls at enemies to immobilize them. His spider-sense will usually alert him when important locations or special obstacles are near.

The game includes various boss fights with the likes of Venom, the Lizard and the Hobgoblin.</desc>

    <desc>The Black Spy and the White Spy have feuded on the pages of MAD magazine for decades. Now they bring their feud to the Game Boy Color. You can play as either the Black Spy or the White Spy, with the goal being to outsmart your opponent and collect five objects hidden throughout the level. As luck would have it, you have an infinite number of booby traps to place throughout the level to get rid of your nemesis. Buckets of water can be set up over doors and items can be rigged with bombs. If your opponent has set a booby trap, you can defuse it with the proper item. Should you get caught in a trap, you have infinite lives, and all you lose is time. If you want a friend to join the mayhem, use a link cable and go at it. Who will be able to survive from one stage to the next in SPY VS SPY?</desc>

    <desc>It&apos;s Street Fighter as you always remember it, with some new moves, characters and combo systems, as well as a more polished look and feel.

The new moves available for each fighter, called Super moves, allow them to fire off very powerful moves. A bar at the bottom of the screen represents the power that you have to use for the moves. You start the first round on 0, and each attack that you make adds power to the bar. Once you reach level 3, you can unleash the special attacks, that can sometimes KO the opponant.

The other major change over the Street Fighter 2 series are the Alpha counters. These can be used to counter an on-coming attack after blocking.</desc>

    <desc>When on a pleasure cruise for his tenth birthday, a young boy is swept castaway to a remote island by a fierce storm that destroys the entire ship.  With no family or friends, he must fend for himself on this strange, seemingly uninhabited island and ultimately find a way to return home.

Survival Kids is presented in an overhead action-RPG style similar to Link&apos;s Awakening.  Players must try to survive through each day by getting enough rest, eating food and drinking water regularly.  This can be risky, as certain foods such as mushrooms can have varying effects including paralysis and poison, while other foods can go rotten and make you sick if you eat it.

The game also features a unique &quot;merge&quot; system, which allows you to create a number of different items by combining two other items.  For example, combining bark and a stick would produce kindling, while using ivy with a bent stick could create a bow.  There are plenty of useless items that can be made in addition to the essentials, so it&apos;s up to the player to think as to what could be helpful in their quest to survive.</desc>

The player chooses between using either a helicopter or a jeep at the beginning of the game and then plays in their chosen vehicles through scrolling levels, shooting at oncoming enemies. Certain enemies when shot drop shield power-ups which can be either picked up to afford temporarily invincibility or detonated to destroy all enemies onscreen. Every so often a boss enemy will attack. The destruction of these bosses will give upgrades to the player&apos;s forward firing gun.</desc>

    <desc>TAZ MUNCHING MADNESS features Taz in his first adventure on Game Boy Color. Playing the game gives the player the same feel as watching the cartoon show with Taz&apos;s signature twist and amusing moments. Presented in a 2D look, the graphics, and scenes on every level have a colorfully appealing view from the top down over the game play. Taz must embark on a mission to save his friend, Wendal T. Wolf from Bull Gator and his crony, Axl. Taz ventures away from his home in Tasmania and must pass through the Amazon Jungle, Amsterdam, Switzerland, the Greek Islands, China, Australia, and more. Those familiar with Taz&apos;s character on the Looney Tunes cartoons will recognize the fact that Taz hasn&apos;t lost his taste for strange and unusual objects as his food source and continues with that practice in his game. Taz literally has to eat his way through each level in order to advance to the next level. Food has significant importance how victorious Taz will be in his mission and even becomes functional at some points. The more food Taz consumes, the faster he will advance and the closer he will get to rescuing his friend. The road to the rescue will be littered with obstacles and challenges from Taz&apos;s enemies. Fans of the Looney Tunes cartoons will want to own this game as well as anyone who enjoys colorful, fast-paced and challenging game play.</desc>

The Soccer Balls bounces of the floor and is bound by gravity, meaning that it will drop of edges etc. The Football travels very quickly and diagonally bounces of everything for a set amount of time. Soccerball and Football &apos;kill&apos; with direct hits.

    <desc>A chase game. Playing either Tom or Jerry, who have slightly different attributes (speed, power, size), the player has to fullfil a bunch of tasks centered around dozens of little nephew mice, invited by Jerry for his birthday and scared of into hiding by Tom. While Tom is looking to beef up his next meal, Jerry is trying to rescue his nephews. Depending on the level, the player has to collect a varying amount of mice during a varying timeframe. Various extras such as bombs, clubs, pans, cheese, a rubber duck and so on help with the task. The player has to run around an 8 way scrolling level and return the mice to his nest/hole (where they could still be bombed, counting for the opponent). Extras can be used to distract, punch, flatten or otherwise execute the opponent, essentially delaying him.

    <desc>The Game Boy Color version of the original Tom Clancy&apos;s Rainbow Six game scales back the 3D visuals of the original game in favor of an almost top-down view, but builds on the same premise of the player controlling a member of the Rainbow counterterrorism unit, responsible for resolving hostage situations and neutralizing threats, in sixteen missions.

The limitations of the platform are not traded in for an arcade-like approach. Just like the major computer version it stresses careful planning and tactics. After a briefing that needs to be followed attentively, the player assumes the role of the commander and assembles a squad of eight operatives, each with different statistics and abilities, based on character traits such as aggression and self-control, physical elements such as stamina, and specific skills including stealth, firearms, electronics, demolitions and many other types of weapons. They can be divided into up to four independent teams. Next, the operatives are outfitted with a selection of six different rifles, six different handguns, 24 types of armor or camouflage and additional tools including heartbeat sensors and door charges. Default equipment is suggested right away, but that is not sufficient for later missions. In the planning mode, the last part of the pre-mission activities, the commander needs to set out waypoints on the map and determine the course of action.

The actual missions are shown in 2D where the different characters can sneak around, blow up doors, rescue hostages and engage the enemy, all requiring a tactical approach. The general plot points and mission objectives are true to the computer version.</desc>

    <desc>Tonic Trouble for the Game Boy Color is a side-scrolling platform game featuring the alien janitor Ed as the protagonist, who spilled a toxic drink on Earth. This is causing all kinds of things to mutate, so agent XYZ is ordering Ed to go clean things up. Meanwhile badguy Grock is taking advantage of the Tonic.

While the story is the same as for the Windows and Nintendo 64 version, the gameplay and levels are quite different. The Game Boy Color version is completely in 2D and plays like a classic 2D platform game. Ed can walk and jump and has to avoid obstacles such as pits, falling platforms, poison spitting holes, and mutated enemies.</desc>

    <desc>This is the first handheld version of Tony Hawk&apos;s popular skateboarding game. It bears little resemblance to the original Playstation version. It is actually composed of two different events, a half pipe and a race mode.

Half pipe mode is viewed from a side perspective, kind of like the classic Skate or Die game. You perform tricks to achieve a high score. Race mode is viewed from a top-down perspective, where you goal is to perform tricks and get to the end quickly.</desc>

Players can select their skater and board, each of which has their own unique stats, allowing you to choose the combination that&apos;s perfect for you.  Each of the thirteen different characters even has their own signature tricks to perform.</desc>

    <desc>Tony Hawk returns with an all new line-up of skaters, an all new line-up of parks to crash through, and a whole new level of graphics.

The line-up of street and vert riders include Elissa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Steve Caballero, Rune Glifberg, Geoff Rowley, Andrew Reynolds, Rodney Mullen, Eric Koston, Chad Muska, Bucky Lasek and Bam Margera from MTV&apos;s Jackass (and Tony Hawk, of course).

The create a skater mode returns, allowing for even further levels of options for your character, like adding glasses and tatoos to changing the colour of the knee and elbow pads or even the hair.

And the levels themselves that you must skate through are now more interactive, with cars and humans blocking paths and making noise as you race around to make as many points as possible. Use items around the streets or the park to jump from or over to increase your score, and pull of as many wild and wacky tricks as you can.</desc>

You rotate your tyre left or right, and drift as the current sends you, making sure to avoid the banks of the river, and the dividing lines in the middle. Hazards include crocodiles, stray logs and branches, and fishermen - you are armed with a limited supply of tin cans to take care of these. There are gates to slide through on the way down - these give you a points bonus. Each level has a strict time limit to adhere to, although there&apos;s a kickin&apos; party at the end if you succeed.</desc>

Championships are split into seasons, each harder then the last. You can opt to change the weather conditions (day, night, sunny, rain, snow) or practise on the track to get used to the corners and timing.

The story is very loosely based on the movie of the same name. The player guides the well known pilot Maverick through a series of realistic training missions to receive graduation from the Top Gun school. The story is advanced in several stills throughout the game.

The player will fly a F-14 Tomcat on an isometric map. He has to complete several objectives in each mission. To achieve those he has four different weapons at his disposal (machine gun, bombs, rockets and missiles). The gameplay is somewhat similar to the Strike series.</desc>

    <desc>On their way to help in the battle against Sargon, a crew of adventurers each skilled in their own way encounter a storm that rips a hole in their ship. Safely reaching Lamini, or Land of Towers, the friendly people of the land help repair the damaged ship. As the crew members are looking for a job, they meet the Mayor of the town who is in need of messengers. He tells the adventurers that Lord Baniff has not been heard from in weeks, and that he needs them to seek him out in his Tower and bring word of his condition. Entering the doorway into the Tower, the entrance collapses behind them and they must find their way out.

The gameplay is similar to other first-person realtime D&amp;D games like the Eye of the Beholder series, though not as complex. There are four characters in the game and you choose one to control. Spell incantations are learned from scrolls and are cast by combining the correct syllables. There are 15 levels to explore and tons of monsters and items to find. You can play the game in cooperative mode with another player using a link cable.</desc>

    <desc>If you&apos;re ready for explosive, mind-twisting puzzle-action mayhem then grab a copy of TROUBALLS from Capcom. In this massively addictive game developed exclusively for the Game Boy Color, it&apos;s up to you to gain as many points as you can while the clock ticks down. Here&apos;s how it works: different colored balls are attached to moving gears; you rotate the gears in an attempt to get four balls of the same color aligned (in a 2x2 square grid at the bottom of the screen), which blows them to smithereens. This clears the stage and advances you to the next level. There&apos;s no time to rest though, as each successive round of sphere-blasting fun is more difficult than the last. You&apos;ll listen to five original songs in the challenging, pop-and-bop gameplay that confronts you on more than 100 fast-moving levels. If you couldn&apos;t get enough of TETRIS or BUST-A-MOVE, then you&apos;ll love TROUBALLS to pieces.</desc>

The sequel to Turok: Dinosaur Hunter.
Having defeated the Chronoceptor, Turok throws the leftovers into a waiting volcano, only to awaken an even deadlier force - The Primagen - who lays in wait for his freedom from a wrecked space craft, buried at the core of the Lost Land.
Now it is up to Turok to once again restore peace to the land, and stop the Primagen from merging Earth with the nether world. New weapons, better graphics, more Turok!!

    <desc>In Turok 2 when Primagen&apos;s Lightship was destroyed, the explosion created a shockwave through out the universe. This effect nearly ends the life of Oblivion, a &apos;thing&apos; the drifts through space, consuming anything that ends up in its way. Also during this explosion, a new world was created. In this world lies the Turok family tree, and Oblivion knows that the only way the pain the lies within can be stopped, is to destroy the Turok line. 

The third title in the Turok series adds two characters to play instead of one, new weapons (as well as some old favourites) and a highly detailed soundtracks with cut-scenes detailing the storyline as you go along.</desc>

If you enjoyed the multiplayer modes in Turok 2, then this is for you.

Instead of the usual Turok single player missions, you must control your character and complete certain missions (from getting the most frags in a time limit, finding an item, or lasting the distance). Before a match you also get to choose which weapons to use, and you can unlock heaps of more weapons and character skins as you complete the objectives.

Multiplayer is the main aim of this game, and there are plenty of 4 player game modes to choose from (frag and tag, capture the flag, Bloodlust, etc.) as well as a 2 player co-op Trial mode (much like the single player missions) time trials and frag fests.

    <desc>UNO, the classic card game of skips, draw-twos, and reverses, has come to the Game Boy Advance. There are two modes of play: Standard and Challenge. Standard has the players keep going until they reach a specified number of points, usually 1000. However, a player only scores points when he gets rid of all the cards in his hand. The points are the total value of the cards left in the opposition&apos;s hands. In Challenge, each player has a set number of points, and a player is eliminated when he reaches the point total. Play continues until one player is left standing. In both modes, you can play against up to three computer-controlled opponents. You can also play a single human opponent via a link cable. As an added bonus, there are three new cards that are not part of the real-world game. Now you can play UNO by yourself.</desc>

    <desc>During a joyride in his biplane, the engine blows and Wario crashes into the woods. It&apos;s here where he finds a hidden cave with a magic Music box. Before he can say &quot;I hate Mario&quot;, the box pulls him inside and into a room with a dark figure, who strikes a deal with him. Find all of the missing Music boxes and he can leave. And any treasure he finds he can keep. 

Much like Wario Land 2, Wario can&apos;t die from any attacks by the enemy. However he can change form after certain attacks, which can both help and halt his progress in each level. New forms of Wario include Invisible Wario and Ball of Yarn Wario (an un-controllable ball of yarn, with Wario inside).

Also, basic attacks such as swimming and the butt stomp don&apos;t become available to Wario until after completing a certain amount of levels, meaning you have to go back to completed levels to access other areas full of loot.</desc>

    <desc>Seeking revenge on Wario after he stole their treasure in Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3, special agents from the Black Sugar Gang of Kitchen Island sneak into Wario&apos;s newly built castle, steal back the treasure, and leave the castle and the surrounding area a mess. As Wario, you must clean the place up and take back what you now call your own.

In a change from the original Wario Land, Wario is now immortal, to a certain point. Instead of dying when hit by an enemy, Wario loses the coins he collected along his travels in each level. And he can also turn into other Warios. For example, if he is hit by a bee, Wario puffs up into a giant ball of air, and floats up to the top of the level. Only when hit by a sharp object will he return to normal. There are other types, like Fire Wario and Zombie Wario, and each can have its advantages, like getting to other areas otherwise unreachable, or they can halt your progress.</desc>

    <desc>In the perilous world of Warlocked, a ferocious war is raging between the Human forces of Queen Azarel and the Beast horde of Chief Zog. Players can control either side, each of them offers 30 missions. 

Warlocked brings real-time strategy gaming to the Boy Color set in a fantasy warfare scenario. The key to victory is a balanced mix of resource gathering, building, exploration and combat. Adding a magical twist to the straightforward action is the presence of wizards, each of whom has one powerful spell. While some wizards can convert enemy troops to your side, others can change them into chickens or skeletons. More than 20 kinds of wizards are hidden throughout the game.

Using a Game Link Cable, you can test your war skills against another player. Two-player battle maps are earned by progressing through the single-player game. Warlocked also enables you to build your own personal armies with resources that you have saved in your campaigns in single player mode, and then trade them with a friend using the infrared ports on the console.</desc>

    <desc>While exploring her house&apos;s attic, the little witch Wendy discovers a treasure chest.  Upon opening it, magical stones are released from their prison, and head to a castle which is suspended in the sky. The power of the stones upsets gravity, and the castle comes crashing to the ground, right on top of Wendy&apos;s house!  It&apos;s up to Wendy to set things right again!

Wendy: Every Witch Way is a combination of a side-scrolling platformer and a puzzle game.  As Wendy, players explore the castle in search of the troublesome stones that have upset gravity.  Wendy has the ability to control gravity herself  by pressing up or down on the control pad while jumping, Wendy will cause gravity to reverse in that direction.  Most enemies and obstacles in the game world are also affected by the gravity switching  you&apos;ll need to manipulate gravity frequently to progress through the game&apos;s different puzzles.

Stars can be used to power up Wendy&apos;s magic.  For every star that she collects (to a maximum of five), her magic will increase.  Beginning with a small weak shot, you can power your magic up to a spread shot that fires in three directions.  The stars also act as Wendy&apos;s health meter  if you get hit, you&apos;ll lose a star, as well as some magical power.  Get hit when you have no stars left, and you&apos;ll lose a life.

At the end of every world, there is a short bonus stage with Wendy riding on her broomstick.  In these stages, you must attack enemies and collect stars as Wendy automatically flies to the next world.</desc>

    <desc>Wings of Fury is an action game with some minor simulation aspects, in which you are the pilot of an American F6F Hellcat plane. The setting of the game is the Pacific during World War II.

It is your job to defeat the Japanese by destroying enemy bunkers, machine gun nests and barracks on a series of islands. Barracks and gun nests can be bombarded with regular bombs, while you&apos;ll have to use rockets to take out the concrete bunkers. After a successful bombing run, return to mow down the Japanese soldiers with your machine guns. You also have to sink Japanese battleships with torpedoes and engage in dogfights with enemy fighter planes.

 
You start each mission by taking off from an aircraft carrier, which you&apos;ll have to protect from assaults by Japanese torpedo planes. Whenever you run out of fuel, bombs, rockets or machine gun ammo you can replenish those by returning to your carrier. Your carrier is also the place to repair damage to your plane.

The Gameboy Color version of Wings of Fury has a toned down violence level. You no longer mow down Japanese soldiers with your machine guns, instead you bombard jeeps &amp; trucks. Also missing in this version are the Japanese torpedo planes and the small 1st-person view window. New are some extra manoeuvres for your plane like a barrel roll and a review of your ammo consumption after each mission. Using less ammo than allocated gives you bonus points.</desc>

The racing action takes place in four different modes: Extreme, Grand Prix, Sprint, and Time Trial. Extreme has players trying to earn cups in a series of races, where the ultimate goal is to win first place in each race. Grand Prix stages races on the same tracks, but players are awarded points based on where they finish. Doing well in the races in both modes allows you to upgrade your vehicle. Both the Sprint and Time Trial modes allow for competition without the bloodlust of the other two modes. If you want to compete against another person, you can via a link cable.

    <desc>The final sequel (at least using the present engine) to the strategy game Worms, Worms Armageddon expands on Worms 2 by improving quite a few facets of gameplay and including play over the Internet through Team 17&apos;s WORMNET. 

For those who&apos;ve never played Worms, it&apos;s at heart similar to the old game Artillery, which you control an artillery piece. In essence, you give it a shot angle and shot power, and try to hit your enemy, despite wind effects and the enemy firing back at you. Worms puts you in command of a team of Worms, but not only can you move around the landscape, you can use many types of weapons to try to dispatch the enemy, from bazookas to mini-guns to exploding sheep. 

Everything is presented in a humorous cartoonish style, from the landscapes to the worms themselves and their cries of triumph or despair, depending on how you do.

Armageddon uses an enhanced version of the Worms 2 engine, and while an improvement over Worms 2, it&apos;s not a huge change.</desc>

The 20 or so game modes included specialty matches like royal rumble, survivor series, tornado matches and more. Also featured was a new career mode compared to that of WWF War Zone, realistic entrances and a first ever Create a PPV mode. The game featured over 40 of the then current WWF Superstars, including hidden ones. The Create A Wrestler feature was one of the most advanced of it&apos;s time.</desc>

    <desc>WWF Betrayal is not the typical WWF game, instead the gameplay is more reminiscent of Double Dragon.  The player starts off as one of either four different superstars including The Rock, Triple H, The Undertaker or &quot;Stone Cold&quot; Steve Austin, after which the story kicks in.  The story consists of the player&apos;s selected wrestler just moments away from winning the WWF Championship before getting hit from behind by an unknown assailant and defeated.  They awake to discover that Stephanie McMahon has also kidnapped and her father Vince promises the player&apos;s character another shot at the title if they rescue Stephanie.

There are six levels to choose from as the player will transverse these stages and fight off referees, street punks security guards and even other WWF superstars with a punch, kick, a dropkick or through various weapons scattered throughout the stage such as steel pipes, nightsticks, 2x4&apos;s along with many more objects.  Not only does the player have to defeat enemies they also have to avoid various traps and pitfalls such as patches of fire, floor traps and laser cannons to name a few.

There are also power-ups that are located in various places throughout the game which can replenish the player&apos;s health and power bar among many others.  Additionally, when the player fills up their power bar they can unleash their character&apos;s unique finishing move such as the Stone Cold Stunner or the Pedigree on a selected enemy.  There is also an option for a second player to join in using a link cable to team up and help out on their friend&apos;s journey.</desc>

    <desc>WWF Wrestlemania 2000 is THQ&apos;s first WWF licenced game after making two previous WCW titles. Wrestlemania 2K picks up where WCW/NWO Revenge left off. The graphics are by far superior as well is the animation. Wrestlemania 2K adds three highly sort after features: Cage match, custom entrances and Create A Wrestler feature.

Wrestlemania 2K features more than 50 real WWF stars as well as the option for 16 custom wrestlers. All the wrestlers come with their real-life theme music, entrance videos (made into slide shows) and entrance performances. A great improvement over the previous game is the &quot;road to Wrestlemania&quot; mode, an enhanced tournament where players can challenge for any number of belts and be challenged by other wrestlers in a 12 month journey that finally leads to Wrestlemania 2000 itself.</desc>

    <desc>Like it&apos;s bigger brother on the PlayStation, X-Men: Mutant Academy on the Game Boy Color is a fighting game starring Marvel&apos;s famous mutants.

The character roster includes four X-Men (Cyclops, Wolverine, Storm and Gambit) and five evil Mutants (Magneto, Toad, Mystique, Sabretooth and Pyro). There are also two additional secret characters, whose unlocking codes are revealed upon beating the game&apos;s story mode.

In addition to the story mode, in which one character takes on all the others in consecutive fights, there is a training mode, battle mode (featuring teams of three characters each), survival mode (one character taking on all others with only a single bar of health) and a versus mode utilizing the Game Link cable.

The Game Boy&apos;s two buttons are used for kicks and punches (or basic mutant abilities like Cyclops&apos; eye beam). During a fight, a rage bar will slowly fill, which allows using powerful special attacks activated through button combos.</desc>

    <desc>You take control of the X-Men (including Wolverine, Storm, Iceman, Gambit, and Cyclops) and must use the powers of each to fight your way through the many levels of evil mutants, crazy machines and boss characters including Magneto. 

You can change the character at any time during the game, which is important as your characters power level decreases as you go. When you change a character, the character you take out rests, and the power level increases. Also, some areas can only be completed by using the certain powers of each character. 

Apart from the normal mode of play, you can also play a second version, where you must fight all of the Boss characters, and if your character runs out of power, you cannot use him/her again.</desc>

    <desc>Wolverine goes it alone in this action platform title, where you take control of the most famous of the X-Men, and hack and slash your way through 20 levels of enemies and bosses. 

There are 4 main things that Wolvie can achieve: 

1) Hack and slash with his claws (the main attack)

2) Jump (very important to get through levels)

3) Heal (stay still, and he will heal a little at a time. Just be careful, each level has a limited amount of time to complete, so don&apos;t stand around too much)

and 4) If you press the attack button (see (1)) several times in a row, Wolvie will go off in a rage. Although hard to control in this state, his attack range improves. He also loses a little health every time)</desc>

    <desc>In the Game Boy Color version of Xtreme Sports, players compete against more than 200 computer-controlled opponents on 25 different tracks in sports such as street luge, skateboarding, inline skating, surfing and skyboarding. At the start of the game, players choose between characters Guppi and Fin and set off on a trip sponsored by the Xtreme Cola Company, which has invited all extreme sports athletes to Xtreme Sports Island to compete in a tournament. Among the people players encounter are the members of the Bone-Heads gang, who are the antagonists. The player&apos;s objective is to unravel the mystery behind them and win the tournament at the same time.

There are two modes available: Practice and Xtreme Island Adventure. In the former, players can participate in 15 different challenges with 3 difficulty settings. In the latter, players move around the island participating in events and exploring the surroundings. Some of the people players meet will give the player clues to solving the mystery of the Bone-Heads while others will issue challenges to compete in various sports. Players collect medals as the player win events. Players must win a certain number of easier challenges before the referees will allow the player into the tougher ones. Along the way players can also find Twitchy Shakes, which are special drinks that will increase the player&apos;s abilities depending on the next event the player enters. Players may be able to attain higher speeds or even become invincible.</desc>

    <desc>The classic Atari 2600 game YAR&apos;S REVENGE has made its way to the Game Boy Color. You take control a giant space fly known as a Yar, and you must destroy the Qotile base on the other side of the screen. But you must first get through the large shield that guards the base. Fortunately, you have an unlimited supply of missiles to destroy the shield, or you can fly into the shield and eat a brick. Once there is an opening in the shield, touch the Qotile base with the Yar to activate the Zorlon Cannon. Once activated, you can fire the cannon to destroy the base. As you progress through the 250 levels, the game moves faster and becomes more challenging. Help Yar destroy the Qotile in YAR&apos;S REVENGE.</desc>

    <desc>It&apos;s the 14th annual Jellystone Park Balloon Fest. And you know what that means for Yogi...campers with pic-a-nic baskets! Yogi has a plan to get those baskets. He&apos;ll pose as a balloon salesman. He just needs to avoid Ranger Smith.

Boo Boo: &quot;But, Yogi, the Ranger isn&apos;t going to like this.&quot;
Yogi: &quot;Not to worry, Boo Boo, I&apos;m smarter than the average bear!&quot;

This is a puzzle game requiring strategy. A cloud above will hold several colored balloons while moving left or right. When it reaches the screen edge, it drops down a bit. You have a picnic basket with two balloons attached. By pressing the B button, you can rotate the balloons 90º and swap the colors. By pressing the A button, you release the balloons. The object is to get three balloons of the same color to touch. They will then pop and will be gone. Remember, the cloud is moving so time your release so the balloons go where you want. You are trying to clear all the balloons to move on.

Every fourth level is a boss level where you have Ranger Smith on top of the cloud. He stomps the cloud to lower it and drops a stone. If the stone hits your basket, you will release your balloons, whether you want to or not, and will not be able to move for a couple seconds. Once you clear all these balloons, you will have defeated Ranger Smith and will move on to the next area. If you match a balloon with an arrow in it, the cloud will move up a little. If the balloons reach the bottom, you lose. You can then choose to restart the level you were on or end the game.</desc>

    <desc>Zebco Fishing! is an officially licensed fishing game for the Game Boy Color. It features 11 different lures and 2 lakes to fish on. The player can participate in a tournament and Blackjack Bass. The tournament mode gives you a limited time to catch the biggest fish. In Blackjack Bass you have to catch 21 pounds worth of fish, similar to the game Black Jack. Each time you catch a fish, you get its weight and can decide to &quot;hit&quot; or &quot;hold&quot;. If you exceed the 21 pounds you lose.

The player can row his boat around the lake until he has found a suitable fishing location, where he can cast his line and wait for the fish to bite. Once a fish is nibbling the bait the player has to hook it and then reel it in. When you do so you must make sure your line doesn&apos;t break by keeping an eye on the tension. 

Weather conditions, time of day and location all have impact on the chance of catching a fish. Each type of lure also improves the odds in specific types of water and weather types. Somewhere in the two lakes also dwells the legendary Lochness Bass a giant fish which is yet to be caught.</desc>

    <desc>A talking lemur? The only place you might find such a thing is Zobooland, the magical place from the PBS series ZOBOOMAFOO. Embark on a nine-level quest to collect as many Animal Friend Cards as possible, a task that will require lots of interaction and cooperation with other creatures. Make your way across each side-scrolling level, trying to keep your energy up by eating Goobleberries. If you don&apos;t eat enough, you&apos;ll run out of energy and fall asleep losing one turn. Collecting 100 Goobleberries will earn you an extra shot at completing the game, but that won&apos;t be easy with so many other tasks to keep your mind on. The game is certainly designed for younger players, but three skill settings (easy, easier, easiest) allow the game&apos;s difficulty to expand as kids grow accustomed to the challenges. Though the journey is long, games can be saved with the use of a password.</desc>
